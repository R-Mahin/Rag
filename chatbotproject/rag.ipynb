I find his stuff rather slick and shallow, to be\\nhonest. It has none of the visceral quality of Alicia’s best work. I don’t\\nknow enough about art to say whether Alicia Berenson will stand the test of\\ntime as a painter. Her talent will always be overshadowed by her notoriety,\\nso it’s hard to be objective. And you might well accuse me of being biased.\\nAll I can offer is my opinion, for what it’s worth. And to me, Alicia was a\\nkind of genius. Apart from her technical skill, her paintings have an\\nuncanny ability to grab your attention—by the throat, almost—and hold it\\nin a viselike grip.\\nGabriel Berenson was murdered six years ago. He was forty-four years\\nold. He was killed on the twenty-fifth of August—it was an unusually hot\\nsummer, you may remember, with some of the highest temperatures ever\\nrecorded. The day he died was the hottest of the year.\\nOn the last day of his life, Gabriel rose early. A car collected him at 5:15\\na.m. from the house he shared with Alicia in northwest London, on the edge\\nof Hampstead Heath, and he was driven to a shoot in Shoreditch. He spent\\nthe day photographing models on a rooftop for Vogue.\\nNot much is known about Alicia’s movements. She had an upcoming\\nexhibition and was behind with her work. It’s likely she spent the day\\npainting in the summerhouse at the end of the garden, which she had\\nrecently converted into a studio. In the end, Gabriel’s shoot ran late, and he\\nwasn’t driven home until eleven p.m.\\nHalf an hour later, their neighbor, Barbie Hellmann, heard several\\ngunshots.

Next to it, in the shadows, Gabriel was seated,\\nmotionless, bound to a chair with wire wrapped around his ankles and\\nwrists. At first the officers thought he was alive. His head lolled slightly to\\none side, as if he were unconscious. Then a beam of light revealed Gabriel\\nhad been shot several times in the face. His handsome features were gone\\nforever, leaving a charred, blackened, bloody mess. The wall behind him\\nwas sprayed with fragments of skull, brains, hair—and blood.\\nBlood was everywhere—splashed on the walls, running in dark rivulets\\nalong the floor, along the grain of the wooden floorboards. The officers\\nassumed it was Gabriel’s blood. But there was too much of it. And then\\nsomething glinted in the torchlight—a knife was on the floor by Alicia’s\\nfeet. Another beam of light revealed the blood spattered on Alicia’s white\\ndress. An officer grabbed her arms and held them up to the light. There\\nwere deep cuts across the veins in her wrists—fresh cuts, bleeding hard.\\nAlicia fought off the attempts to save her life; it took three officers to\\nrestrain her. She was taken to the Royal Free Hospital, only a few minutes\\naway. She collapsed and lost consciousness on the way there. She had lost a\\nlot of blood, but she survived.\\nThe following day, she lay in bed in a private room at the hospital. The\\npolice questioned her in the presence of her lawyer. Alicia remained silent\\nthroughout the interview. Her lips were pale, bloodless; they fluttered\\noccasionally but formed no words, made no sounds. She answered no\\nquestions.

A monster.\\nThe facts, such as they were, were simple: Alicia was found alone with\\nGabriel’s body; only her fingerprints were on the gun. There was never any\\ndoubt she killed Gabriel. Why she killed him, on the other hand, remained a\\nmystery.\\nThe murder was debated in the media, and different theories were\\nespoused in print and on the radio and on morning chat shows.

The judge dismissed a lot of this as\\nhearsay—but in the end he allowed himself to be swayed by Lazarus\\nDiomedes, professor of forensic psychiatry at Imperial College, and clinical\\ndirector of the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London. Professor\\nDiomedes argued that Alicia’s refusal to speak was in itself evidence of\\nprofound psychological distress—and she should be sentenced accordingly.\\nThis was a rather roundabout way of saying something that psychiatrists\\ndon’t like putting bluntly:\\nDiomedes was saying Alicia was mad.\\nIt was the only explanation that made any sense: Why else tie up the man\\nyou loved to a chair and shoot him in the face at close range?

Alicia was subsequently\\nadmitted to the Grove—under the supervision of the same Professor\\nDiomedes whose testimony had been so influential with the judge.\\nIf Alicia wasn’t mad—that is, if her silence was merely an act, a\\nperformance for the benefit of the jury—then it had worked. She was spared\\na lengthy prison sentence—and if she made a full recovery, she might well\\nbe discharged in a few years. Surely now was the time to begin faking that\\nrecovery? To utter a few words here and there, then a few more; to slowly\\ncommunicate some kind of remorse? But no.

I find music to be a most effective therapeutic tool.” He\\npaused to recite in a lilting, musical tone, “‘Music hath charms to soothe a\\nsavage breast.’ Do you agree?”\\n“I’m sure you’re right.”'),\n",

No answers, not\\nyet—just questions.\\nI wrote down a word and underlined it: ALCESTIS.\\nThe self-portrait—it was important, somehow, I knew that, and\\nunderstanding why would be central to unlocking this mystery. This\\npainting was Alicia’s sole communication, her only testimony. It was saying\\nsomething I had yet to comprehend.

The seeds of what\\nhappened in those few minutes when she shot her husband were probably\\nsown years earlier. Murderous rage, homicidal rage, is not born in the\\npresent. It originates in the land before memory, in the world of early\\nchildhood, with abuse and mistreatment, which builds up a charge over the\\nyears, until it explodes—often at the wrong target.

But the truth is he’s a deeply romantic man—in his heart if\\nnot his speech. Actions speak louder than words, don’t they? And Gabriel’s\\nactions make me feel totally loved.\\n“Where do you want to go?” I asked.\\n“Three guesses.”\\n“Augusto’s?”\\n“Got it in one.”\\nAugusto’s is our local Italian restaurant, just down the road. It’s nothing\\nspecial, but it’s our home from home, and we’ve spent many happy evenings\\nthere. We went around eight o’clock. The air-conditioning wasn’t working,\\nso we sat by the open window in the hot, still, humid air and drank chilled\\ndry white wine. I felt quite drunk by the end, and we laughed a lot, at\\nnothing, really. We kissed outside the restaurant and had sex when we came\\nhome.'),\n",

When I met Kathy and fell in love, marijuana faded into\\nthe background. I was naturally high on love, with no need to artificially\\ninduce a good mood. It helped that Kathy didn’t smoke it.

A short,\\nstubby man, wearing a pair of neon-pink glasses, nudged me and said,\\n“Want some?” I was about to refuse the joint between his fingers, when\\nsomething stopped me. I’m not sure what.

I’d spend hours hiding there. I may not have\\nbeen a happy child, but during the time I spent under the willow tree, I felt a\\nsimilar contentment to lying here with Gabriel.

Gabriel fell asleep, and I sketched\\nhim, trying to capture the dappled sunlight on his face. I did a better job\\nwith his eyes this time. It was easier because they were closed—but at least\\nI got their shape right.

I felt glad to be out of London—\\nthe sky was less oppressive, and I could breathe more easily.\\nI left the train along with a trickle of students and tourists, using the map\\non my phone to guide me. The streets were quiet; I could hear my footsteps\\non the pavement echoing. Abruptly the road stopped. A wasteland lay\\nahead, muddy earth and grass leading to the river.\\nOnly one house stood alone by the river. Obstinate and imposing, like a\\nlarge red brick thrust into the mud. It was ugly, a Victorian monster. The\\nwalls were overgrown with ivy, and the garden had been overtaken by\\nplants, weeds mostly. I got the sense of nature encroaching, reclaiming\\nterritory that had once been hers. This was the house where Alicia had been\\nborn. It was where she spent the first eighteen years of her life. Within these\\nwalls her personality had been formed: the roots of her adult life, all causes\\nand subsequent choices, were buried here. Sometimes it’s hard to grasp why\\nthe answers to the present lie in the past. A simple analogy might be\\nhelpful: a leading psychiatrist in the field of sexual abuse once told me she\\nhad, in thirty years of extensive work with pedophiles, never met one who\\nhadn’t himself been abused as a child. This doesn’t mean that all abused\\nchildren go on to become abusers, but it is impossible for someone who was\\nnot abused to become an abuser. No one is born evil. As Winnicott put it,\\n“A baby cannot hate the mother, without the mother first hating the baby.”\\nAs babies, we are innocent sponges, blank slates, with only the most basic\\nneeds present: to eat, shit, love, and be loved. But something goes wrong,\\ndepending on the circumstances into which we are born, and the house in\\nwhich we grow up. A tormented, abused child can never take revenge in\\nreality, as she is powerless and defenseless, but she can—and must—harbor\\nvengeful fantasies in her imagination. Rage, like fear, is reactive.'),\n",

A rifle.\\n“That’s the gun that killed him?”\\nJean-Felix nodded. “Yes. It belonged to him, I think.”\\n“And this was painted before his murder?”\\n“A month or so before.

Then I turned and looked. The\\nmoment I saw the painting, I let out an involuntary laugh.\\nThe subject was Alicia’s aunt, Lydia Rose. It was obvious why she had\\nbeen so upset by it. Lydia was nude, reclining on a tiny bed. The bed was\\nbuckling under her weight. She was enormously, monstrously fat—an\\nexplosion of flesh spilling over the bed and hitting the floor and spreading\\nacross the room, rippling and folding like waves of gray custard.\\n“Jesus. That’s cruel.”\\n“I think it’s quite lovely.” Jean-Felix looked at me with interest. “You\\nknow Lydia?”\\n“Yes, I went to visit her.”\\n“I see.” He smiled. “You have been doing your homework. I never met\\nLydia.

Follow me.”\\nJean-Felix led me along the narrow passage to the end of the gallery.\\nThere the Alcestis occupied a wall to itself. It was just as beautiful and\\nmysterious as I remembered it. Alicia naked in the studio, in front of a\\nblank canvas, painting with a bloodred paintbrush. I studied Alicia’s\\nexpression. Again it defied interpretation. I frowned.\\n“She’s impossible to read.”\\n“That’s the point—it is a refusal to comment. It’s a painting about\\nsilence.”\\n“I’m not sure I understand what you mean.”\\n“Well, at the heart of all art lies a mystery. Alicia’s silence is her secret—\\nher mystery, in the religious sense. That’s why she named it Alcestis. Have\\nyou read it? By Euripides.” He gave me a curious look. “Read it. Then\\nyou’ll understand.”\\nI nodded—and then I noticed something in the painting I hadn’t before. I\\nleaned forward to look closely. A bowl of fruit sat on the table in the\\nbackground of the picture—a collection of apples and pears. On the red\\napples were some small white blobs—slippery white blobs creeping in and\\naround the fruit.\\nI pointed at them. “Are they…?”\\n“Maggots?” Jean-Felix nodded. “Yes.”'),\n",

What could be serious\\nenough that Paul would turn to me, of all people? Was it about Lydia? Or\\nthe house, perhaps? It didn’t make sense.\\nI wasn’t able to get any work done after lunch. I blamed the heat, but in\\ntruth my mind was elsewhere. I hung around in the kitchen, glancing out the\\nwindows, until I saw Paul on the street.\\nHe waved at me. “Alicia, hi.”\\nThe first thing that struck me was how terrible he looked. He’d lost a lot of\\nweight, particularly around his face, the temples and jaw. He looked\\nskeletal, unwell. Exhausted. Scared.\\nWe sat in the kitchen with the portable fan on. I offered him a beer but he\\nsaid he’d rather have something stronger, which surprised me because I\\ndon’t remember him being much of a drinker. I poured him a whiskey—a\\nsmall one—and he topped it up when he thought I wasn’t looking.\\nHe didn’t say anything at first. We sat there in silence for a moment. Then\\nhe repeated what he had said on the phone. The same words:\\n“I’m in trouble.”\\nI asked him what he meant. Was it about the house?\\nPaul looked at me blankly. No, it wasn’t the house.\\n“Then what?”\\n“It’s me.” He hesitated, then came out with it. “I’ve been gambling. And\\nlosing a lot, I’m afraid.”\\nHe’d been gambling regularly for years. He said it started as a way of\\ngetting out of the house—somewhere to go, something to do, a bit of fun—\\nand I can’t say I blame him. Living with Lydia, fun must be in short supply.\\nBut he’s been losing more and more, and now it had gotten out of hand.'),\n",

He followed her into it and\\nthey vanished.\\nI felt a sick feeling of dread in my stomach. My breathing was thick,\\nslow, heavy. Every part of my body was telling me to leave, go, run, run\\naway. But I didn’t. I followed them into the woods.\\nI tried to make as little noise as possible, but twigs crunched under my\\nfeet, and branches clawed at me. I couldn’t see them anywhere—the trees\\ngrew so closely together that I could only see a few feet in front of me.\\nI stopped and listened. I heard a rustling in the trees, but it could have\\nbeen the wind. Then I heard something unmistakable, a low-pitched\\nguttural sound I recognized at once.\\nIt was Kathy moaning.\\nI tried to get closer, but the branches caught me and held me suspended,\\nlike a fly in a web. I stood there in the dim light, breathing in the musty\\nsmell of bark and earth. I listened to Kathy moaning as he fucked her. He\\ngrunted like an animal.\\nI burned with hate. This man had come from nowhere and invaded my\\nlife. He had stolen and seduced and corrupted the one thing in the world\\nthat was precious to me. It was monstrous—supernatural. Perhaps he wasn’t\\nhuman at all, but the instrument of some malevolent deity intent on\\npunishing me. Was God punishing me? Why? What was I guilty of—except\\nfalling in love? Was it that I loved too deeply, too needily? Too much?\\nDid this man love her? I doubted it. Not the way I did. He was just using\\nher; using her body. There was no way he cared for her as I did. I would\\nhave died for Kathy.\\nI would have killed for her.\\nI thought of my father—I knew what he’d do in this situation. He’d\\nmurder the guy. Be a man, I could hear my father shouting. Toughen up.\\nWas that what I should do? Kill him? Dispose of him? It was a way out of\\nthis mess—a way to break the spell, release Kathy and set us free. Once she\\nhad grieved his loss, it would be over, he’d just be a memory, easily\\nforgotten, and we could go on as before. I could do it now, here, in the park.'),\n",

I thought if I could keep him talking, I had\\na better chance of staying alive. So I answered his questions—about me,\\nGabriel, my work. I talked about whatever he wanted. Just to buy time.

All I\\nwanted was to awaken Alicia to the truth about her marriage, as I had been\\nawakened. I intended to show her that Gabriel didn’t love her, that her life\\nwas a lie, their marriage a sham. Only then would she have a chance, as I\\nhad, to build a new life from the rubble; a life based on truth, not lies.\\nI had no idea about Alicia’s history of instability. Had I known, I never\\nwould have pushed things so far. I had no idea she would react like that.\\nAnd when the story was all over the press and Alicia was on trial for\\nmurder, I felt a deep sense of personal responsibility, and the desire to\\nexpiate my guilt and prove that I was not responsible for what had\\nhappened. So I applied for the job at the Grove. I wanted to help her\\nthrough the aftermath of the murder—help her understand what had\\nhappened, work through it—and be free.

But Alicia didn’t seem to recognize me, and I was able\\nto play a new part in her life. Then, that night in Cambridge, I finally\\nunderstood what I had unwittingly reenacted, the long-forgotten land mine\\non which I had trodden. Gabriel was the second man to condemn Alicia to\\ndeath; bringing up this original trauma was more than she could bear—\\nwhich is why she picked up the gun and visited her long-awaited revenge\\nnot upon her father, but upon her husband.

Lanka has done an important job in making this point clear\\nas Cowan did in his analysis of the CDC paper. Lanka says that all\\nclaims about viruses as disease-causing pathogens are wrong and\\nbased on ‘easily recognisable, understandable and veriﬁable\\nmisinterpretations.’ Scientists believed they were working with\\n‘viruses’ in their laboratories when they were really working with\\n‘typical particles of speciﬁc dying tissues or cells …’ Lanka said that\\nthe tissue decaying process claimed to be caused by a ‘virus’ still\\nhappens when no alleged ‘virus’ is involved. It’s the process that does\\nthe damage and not a ‘virus’. The genetic sample is deprived of\\nnutrients, removed from its energy supply through removal from\\nthe body and then doused in toxic antibiotics to remove any bacteria.\\nHe conﬁrms again that establishment scientists do not (pinch me)'),\n",

An\\nincrease in levels of anxiety, aggression, depression, forgetfulness\\nand hallucinations were possible psychological eﬀects of isolation.\\n‘Mental conditions may be precipitated for those with underlying\\npre-existing susceptibilities and show up in many others without\\nany pre-condition.’ Powar said personal relationships helped us cope\\nwith stress and if we lost this outlet for le\\x00ing oﬀ steam the result\\ncan be a big emotional void which, for an average person, was\\ndiﬃcult to deal with. ‘Just a few days of isolation can cause\\nincreased levels of anxiety and depression’ – so what the hell has\\nbeen the eﬀect on the global population of 18 months of this at the\\ntime of writing? Powar said: ‘Add to it the looming threat of a\\ndreadful disease being repeatedly hammered in through the media\\nand you have a recipe for many shades of mental and physical\\ndistress.’ For those with a house and a garden it is easy to forget that\\nbillions have had to endure lockdown isolation in tiny overcrowded\\nﬂats and apartments with nowhere to go outside. The psychological\\nand physical consequences of this are unimaginable and with lunatic\\nand abusive partners and parents the consequences have led to\\ntremendous increases in domestic and child abuse and alcoholism as\\npeople seek to shut out the horror. Ranjit Powar said:\\nStaying in a confined space with family is not all a rosy picture for everyone. It can be\\nextremely oppressive and claustrophobic for large low-income families huddled together in\\nsmall single-room houses.

For my parents But why does she not speak?\\n—EURIPIDES, Alcestis PROLOGUE\\nAlicia Berenson’s Diary\\nJULY 14\\nI don’t know why I’m writing this.\\nThat’s not true. Maybe I do know and just don’t want to admit it to myself\\nI don’t even know what to call it—this thing I’m writing. It feels a little\\npretentious to call it a diary. It’s not like I have anything to say. Anne Frank\\nkept a diary—not someone like me. Calling it a “journal” sounds too\\nacademic, somehow. As if I should write in it every day, and I don’t want to\\n—if it becomes a chore, I’ll never keep it up.\\nMaybe I’ll call it nothing. An unnamed something that I occasionally write\\nin. I like that better. Once you name something, it stops you seeing the\\nwhole of it, or why it matters. You focus on the word, which is just the tiniest\\npart, really, the tip of an iceberg. I’ve never been that comfortable with\\nwords—I always think in pictures, express myself with images—so I’d never\\nhave started writing this if it weren’t for Gabriel.\\nI’ve been feeling depressed lately, about a few things. I thought I was doing\\na good job of hiding it, but he noticed—of course he did, he notices\\neverything. He asked how the painting was going—I said it wasn’t. He got\\nme a glass of wine, and I sat at the kitchen table while he cooked.\\nI like watching Gabriel move around the kitchen. He’s a graceful cook—\\nelegant, balletic, organized. Unlike me. I just make a mess.\\n“Talk to me,” he said.\\n“There’s nothing to say. I just get so stuck in my head sometimes. I feel like\\nI’m wading through mud.” “Why don’t you try writing things down? Keeping some kind of record?\\nThat might help.”\\n“Yes, I suppose so. I’ll try it.”\\n“Don’t just say it, darling. Do it.”\\n“I will.”\\nHe kept nagging me, but I did nothing about it. And then a few days later he\\npresented me with this little book to write in. It has a black leather cover\\nand thick white blank pages. I ran my hand across the first page, feeling its\\nsmoothness—then sharpened my pencil and began.\\nHe was right, of course. I feel better already—writing this down is\\nproviding a kind of release, an outlet, a space to express myself. A bit like\\ntherapy, I suppose.\\nGabriel didn’t say it, but I could tell he’s concerned about me. And if I’m\\ngoing to be honest—and I may as well be—the real reason I agreed to keep\\nthis diary was to reassure him—prove that I’m okay. I can’t bear the\\nthought of him worrying about me.

They were both artists—Alicia\\nwas a painter, and Gabriel was a well-known fashion photographer. He had\\na distinctive style, shooting semi-starved, semi-naked women in strange,\\nunflattering angles. Since his death, the price of his photographs has\\nincreased astronomically. I find his stuff rather slick and shallow, to be\\nhonest. It has none of the visceral quality of Alicia’s best work. I don’t\\nknow enough about art to say whether Alicia Berenson will stand the test of\\ntime as a painter. Her talent will always be overshadowed by her notoriety,\\nso it’s hard to be objective. And you might well accuse me of being biased.\\nAll I can offer is my opinion, for what it’s worth. And to me, Alicia was a\\nkind of genius. Apart from her technical skill, her paintings have an\\nuncanny ability to grab your attention—by the throat, almost—and hold it\\nin a viselike grip.\\nGabriel Berenson was murdered six years ago. He was forty-four years\\nold. He was killed on the twenty-fifth of August—it was an unusually hot\\nsummer, you may remember, with some of the highest temperatures ever\\nrecorded. The day he died was the hottest of the year.\\nOn the last day of his life, Gabriel rose early. A car collected him at 5:15\\na.m. from the house he shared with Alicia in northwest London, on the edge\\nof Hampstead Heath, and he was driven to a shoot in Shoreditch. He spent\\nthe day photographing models on a rooftop for Vogue.\\nNot much is known about Alicia’s movements. She had an upcoming\\nexhibition and was behind with her work. It’s likely she spent the day\\npainting in the summerhouse at the end of the garden, which she had\\nrecently converted into a studio. In the end, Gabriel’s shoot ran late, and he\\nwasn’t driven home until eleven p.m.\\nHalf an hour later, their neighbor, Barbie Hellmann, heard several\\ngunshots. Barbie phoned the police, and a car was dispatched from the station on Haverstock Hill at 11:35 p.m. It arrived at the Berensons’ house\\nin just under three minutes.\\nThe front door was open. The house was in pitch-black darkness; none of\\nthe light switches worked. The officers made their way along the hallway\\nand into the living room. They shone torches around the room, illuminating\\nit in intermittent beams of light. Alicia was discovered standing by the\\nfireplace. Her white dress glowed ghostlike in the torchlight. Alicia seemed\\noblivious to the presence of the police. She was immobilized, frozen—a\\nstatue carved from ice—with a strange, frightened look on her face, as if\\nconfronting some unseen terror.\\nA gun was on the floor. Next to it, in the shadows, Gabriel was seated,\\nmotionless, bound to a chair with wire wrapped around his ankles and\\nwrists. At first the officers thought he was alive. His head lolled slightly to\\none side, as if he were unconscious. Then a beam of light revealed Gabriel\\nhad been shot several times in the face. His handsome features were gone\\nforever, leaving a charred, blackened, bloody mess. The wall behind him\\nwas sprayed with fragments of skull, brains, hair—and blood.\\nBlood was everywhere—splashed on the walls, running in dark rivulets\\nalong the floor, along the grain of the wooden floorboards. The officers\\nassumed it was Gabriel’s blood. But there was too much of it. And then\\nsomething glinted in the torchlight—a knife was on the floor by Alicia’s\\nfeet. Another beam of light revealed the blood spattered on Alicia’s white\\ndress. An officer grabbed her arms and held them up to the light. There\\nwere deep cuts across the veins in her wrists—fresh cuts, bleeding hard.\\nAlicia fought off the attempts to save her life; it took three officers to\\nrestrain her. She was taken to the Royal Free Hospital, only a few minutes\\naway. She collapsed and lost consciousness on the way there. She had lost a\\nlot of blood, but she survived.\\nThe following day, she lay in bed in a private room at the hospital. The\\npolice questioned her in the presence of her lawyer. Alicia remained silent\\nthroughout the interview. Her lips were pale, bloodless; they fluttered\\noccasionally but formed no words, made no sounds. She answered no\\nquestions. She could not, would not, speak. Nor did she speak when\\ncharged with Gabriel’s murder. She remained silent when she was placed\\nunder arrest, refusing to deny her guilt or confess it.\\nAlicia never spoke again. Her enduring silence turned this story from a commonplace domestic\\ntragedy into something far grander: a mystery, an enigma that gripped the\\nheadlines and captured the public imagination for months to come.\\nAlicia remained silent—but she made one statement. A painting. It was\\nbegun when she was discharged from the hospital and placed under house\\narrest before the trial. According to the court-appointed psychiatric nurse,\\nAlicia barely ate or slept—all she did was paint.\\nNormally Alicia labored weeks, even months, before embarking on a\\nnew picture, making endless sketches, arranging and rearranging the\\ncomposition, experimenting with color and form—a long gestation\\nfollowed by a protracted birth as each brushstroke was painstakingly\\napplied. Now, however, she drastically altered her creative process,\\ncompleting this painting within a few days of her husband’s murder.\\nAnd for most people, this was enough to condemn her—returning to the\\nstudio so soon after Gabriel’s death betrayed an extraordinary insensitivity.\\nThe monstrous lack of remorse of a cold-blooded killer.\\nPerhaps. But let us not forget that while Alicia Berenson may be a\\nmurderer, she was also an artist. It makes perfect sense—to me at least—\\nthat she should pick up her brushes and paints and express her complicated\\nemotions on canvas. No wonder that, for once, painting came to her with\\nsuch ease; if grief can be called easy.\\nThe painting was a self-portrait. She titled it in the bottom left-hand\\ncorner of the canvas, in light blue Greek lettering.\\nOne word:\\nAlcestis. CHAPTER TWO\\nALCESTIS IS THE HEROINE OF A GREEK MYTH. A love story of the saddest kind.\\nAlcestis willingly sacrifices her life for that of her husband, Admetus, dying\\nin his place when no one else will. An unsettling myth of self-sacrifice, it\\nwas unclear how it related to Alicia’s situation. The true meaning of the\\nallusion remained unknown to me for some time. Until one day, the truth\\ncame to light—\\nBut I’m going too fast. I’m getting ahead of myself. I must start at the\\nbeginning and let events speak for themselves. I mustn’t color them, twist\\nthem, or tell any lies. I’ll proceed step by step, slowly and cautiously. But\\nwhere to begin? I should introduce myself, but perhaps not quite yet; after\\nall, I am not the hero of this tale. It is Alicia Berenson’s story, so I must\\nbegin with her—and the Alcestis.\\nThe painting is a self-portrait, depicting Alicia in her studio at home in\\nthe days after the murder, standing before an easel and a canvas, holding a\\npaintbrush. She is naked. Her body is rendered in unsparing detail: strands\\nof long red hair falling across bony shoulders, blue veins visible beneath\\ntranslucent skin, fresh scars on both her wrists. She’s holding the paintbrush\\nbetween her fingers. It’s dripping red paint—or is it blood? She is captured\\nin the act of painting—yet the canvas is blank, as is her expression. Her\\nhead is turned over her shoulder and she stares straight out at us. Mouth\\nopen, lips parted. Mute.\\nDuring the trial, Jean-Felix Martin, who managed the small Soho gallery\\nthat represented Alicia, made the controversial decision, decried by many as\\nsensationalist and macabre, to exhibit the Alcestis. The fact that the artist\\nwas currently in the dock for killing her husband meant, for the first time in\\nthe gallery’s long history, queues formed outside the entrance.\\nI stood in line with the other prurient art-lovers, waiting my turn by the\\nneon-red lights of a sex shop next door. One by one, we shuffled inside.\\nOnce in the gallery, we were herded toward the painting, like an excitable crowd at a fairground making its way through a haunted house. Eventually,\\nI found myself at the front of the line—and was confronted with the\\nAlcestis.\\nI stared at the painting, staring into Alicia’s face, trying to interpret the\\nlook in her eyes, trying to understand—but the portrait defied me. Alicia\\nstared back at me—a blank mask—unreadable, impenetrable. I could divine\\nneither innocence nor guilt in her expression.\\nOther people found her easier to read.\\n“Pure evil,” whispered the woman behind me.\\n“Isn’t she?” her companion agreed. “Cold-blooded bitch.”\\nA little unfair, I thought—considering Alicia’s guilt had yet to be proven.\\nBut in truth it was a foregone conclusion. The tabloids had cast her as a\\nvillain from the start: a femme fatale, a black widow. A monster.\\nThe facts, such as they were, were simple: Alicia was found alone with\\nGabriel’s body; only her fingerprints were on the gun. There was never any\\ndoubt she killed Gabriel. Why she killed him, on the other hand, remained a\\nmystery.\\nThe murder was debated in the media, and different theories were\\nespoused in print and on the radio and on morning chat shows. Experts\\nwere brought in to explain, condemn, justify Alicia’s actions. She must\\nhave been a victim of domestic abuse, surely, pushed too far, before finally\\nexploding? Another theory proposed a sex game gone wrong—the husband\\nwas found tied up, wasn’t he? Some suspected it was old-fashioned jealousy\\nthat drove Alicia to murder—another woman, probably? But at the trial\\nGabriel was described by his brother as a devoted husband, deeply in love\\nwith his wife. Well, what about money? Alicia didn’t stand to gain much by\\nhis death; she was the one who had money, inherited from her father.\\nAnd so it went on, endless speculation—no answers, only more questions\\n—about Alicia’s motives and her subsequent silence. Why did she refuse to\\nspeak? What did it mean? Was she hiding something? Protecting someone?\\nIf so, who? And why?\\nAt the time, I remember thinking that while everyone was talking,\\nwriting, arguing, about Alicia, at the heart of this frantic, noisy activity\\nthere was a void—a silence. A sphinx.\\nDuring the trial, the judge took a dim view of Alicia’s persistent refusal\\nto speak. Innocent people, Mr. Justice Alverstone pointed out, tended to\\nproclaim their innocence loudly—and often. Alicia not only remained silent, but she showed no visible signs of remorse. She didn’t cry once\\nthroughout the trial—a fact made much of in the press—her face remaining\\nunmoved, cold. Frozen.\\nThe defense had little choice but to enter a plea of diminished\\nresponsibility: Alicia had a long history of mental health problems, it was\\nclaimed, dating back to her childhood. The judge dismissed a lot of this as\\nhearsay—but in the end he allowed himself to be swayed by Lazarus\\nDiomedes, professor of forensic psychiatry at Imperial College, and clinical\\ndirector of the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London. Professor\\nDiomedes argued that Alicia’s refusal to speak was in itself evidence of\\nprofound psychological distress—and she should be sentenced accordingly.\\nThis was a rather roundabout way of saying something that psychiatrists\\ndon’t like putting bluntly:\\nDiomedes was saying Alicia was mad.\\nIt was the only explanation that made any sense: Why else tie up the man\\nyou loved to a chair and shoot him in the face at close range? And then\\nexpress no remorse, give no explanation, not even speak? She must be mad.\\nShe had to be.\\nIn the end, Mr. Justice Alverstone accepted the plea of diminished\\nresponsibility and advised the jury to follow suit. Alicia was subsequently\\nadmitted to the Grove—under the supervision of the same Professor\\nDiomedes whose testimony had been so influential with the judge.\\nIf Alicia wasn’t mad—that is, if her silence was merely an act, a\\nperformance for the benefit of the jury—then it had worked. She was spared\\na lengthy prison sentence—and if she made a full recovery, she might well\\nbe discharged in a few years. Surely now was the time to begin faking that\\nrecovery? To utter a few words here and there, then a few more; to slowly\\ncommunicate some kind of remorse? But no. Week followed week, month\\nfollowed month, then the years passed—and still Alicia didn’t speak.\\nThere was simply silence.\\nAnd so, with no further revelation forthcoming, the disappointed media\\neventually lost interest in Alicia Berenson. She joined the ranks of other\\nbriefly famous murderers; faces we remember, but whose names we forget.\\nNot all of us. Some people—myself included—continued to be\\nfascinated by the mystery of Alicia Berenson and her enduring silence. As a\\npsychotherapist, I thought it obvious that she had suffered a severe trauma\\nsurrounding Gabriel’s death; and this silence was a manifestation of that trauma. Unable to come to terms with what she had done, Alicia stuttered\\nand came to a halt, like a broken car. I wanted to help start her up again—\\nhelp Alicia tell her story, to heal and get well. I wanted to fix her.\\nWithout wishing to sound boastful, I felt uniquely qualified to help Alicia\\nBerenson. I’m a forensic psychotherapist and used to working with some of\\nthe most damaged, vulnerable members of society. And something about\\nAlicia’s story resonated with me personally—I felt a profound empathy\\nwith her right from the start.\\nUnfortunately, I was still working at Broadmoor in those days, and so\\ntreating Alicia would have—should have—remained an idle fantasy, had\\nnot fate unexpectedly intervened.\\nNearly six years after Alicia was admitted, the position of forensic\\npsychotherapist became available at the Grove. As soon as I saw the advert,\\nI knew I had no choice. I followed my gut—and applied for the job. CHAPTER THREE\\nMY NAME IS THEO FABER. I’m forty-two years old. And I became a\\npsychotherapist because I was fucked-up. That’s the truth—though it’s not\\nwhat I said during the job interview, when the question was put to me.\\n“What drew you to psychotherapy, do you think?” asked Indira Sharma,\\npeering at me over the rims of her owlish glasses.\\nIndira was consultant psychotherapist at the Grove. She was in her late\\nfifties with an attractive round face and long jet-black hair streaked with\\ngray. She gave me a small smile—as if to reassure me this was an easy\\nquestion, a warm-up volley, a precursor to trickier shots to follow.\\nI hesitated. I could feel the other members of the panel looking at me. I\\nremained conscious of maintaining eye contact as I trotted out a rehearsed\\nresponse, a sympathetic tale about working part-time in a care home as a\\nteenager; and how this inspired an interest in psychology, which led to a\\npostgraduate study of psychotherapy, and so on.\\n“I wanted to help people, I suppose.” I shrugged. “That’s it, really.”\\nWhich was bullshit.\\nI mean, of course I wanted to help people. But that was a secondary aim\\n—particularly at the time I started training. The real motivation was purely\\nselfish. I was on a quest to help myself. I believe the same is true for most\\npeople who go into mental health. We are drawn to this profession because\\nwe are damaged—we study psychology to heal ourselves. Whether we are\\nprepared to admit this or not is another question.\\nAs human beings, in our earliest years we reside in a land before\\nmemory. We like to think of ourselves as emerging from this primordial fog\\nwith our characters fully formed, like Aphrodite rising perfect from the sea\\nfoam. But thanks to increasing research into the development of the brain,\\nwe know this is not the case. We are born with a brain half-formed—more\\nlike a muddy lump of clay than a divine Olympian. As the psychoanalyst\\nDonald Winnicott put it, “There is no such thing as a baby.” The development of our personalities doesn’t take place in isolation, but in\\nrelationship with others—we are shaped and completed by unseen,\\nunremembered forces; namely, our parents.\\nThis is frightening, for obvious reasons. Who knows what indignities we\\nsuffered, what torments and abuses, in this land before memory? Our\\ncharacter was formed without our even knowing it. In my case, I grew up\\nfeeling edgy, afraid; anxious. This anxiety seemed to predate my existence\\nand exist independently of me. But I suspect it originated in my relationship\\nwith my father, around whom I was never safe.\\nMy father’s unpredictable and arbitrary rages made any situation, no\\nmatter how benign, into a potential minefield. An innocuous remark or a\\ndissenting voice would trigger his anger and set off a series of explosions\\nfrom which there was no refuge. The house shook as he shouted, chasing\\nme upstairs into my room. I’d dive and slide under the bed, against the wall.\\nI’d breathe in the feathery air, praying the bricks would swallow me up and\\nI would disappear. But his hand would grab hold of me, drag me out to meet\\nmy fate. The belt would be pulled off and whistle in the air before it struck,\\neach successive blow knocking me sideways, burning my flesh. Then the\\nwhipping would be over, as abruptly as it had begun. I’d be tossed to the\\nfloor, landing in a crumpled heap. A rag doll discarded by an angry toddler.\\nI was never sure what I had done to trigger this anger, or if I deserved it. I\\nasked my mother why my father was always so angry with me, and she\\ngave a despairing shrug and said, “How should I know? Your father’s\\ncompletely mad.”\\nWhen she said he was mad, she wasn’t joking. If assessed by a\\npsychiatrist today, my father would, I suspect, be diagnosed with a\\npersonality disorder—an illness that went untreated for the duration of his\\nlife. The result was a childhood and adolescence dominated by hysteria and\\nphysical violence: threats, tears, and breaking glass.\\nThere were moments of happiness; usually when my father was away\\nfrom home. I remember one winter he was in America on a business trip for\\na month. For thirty days, my mother and I had free rein of the house and\\ngarden without his watchful eye. It snowed heavily in London that\\nDecember, and the whole of our garden was buried beneath a crisp thick\\nwhite carpet. Mum and I made a snowman. Unconsciously or not, we built\\nhim to represent our absent master: I christened him Dad, and with his big\\nbelly, two black stones for eyes, and two slanting twigs for stern eyebrows, the resemblance was uncanny. We completed the illusion by giving him my\\nfather’s gloves, hat, and umbrella. Then we pelted him violently with\\nsnowballs, giggling like naughty children.\\nThere was a heavy snowstorm that night. My mother went to bed and I\\npretended to sleep, then I snuck out to the garden and stood under the\\nfalling snow. I held my hands outstretched, catching snowflakes, watching\\nthem vanish on my fingertips. It felt joyous and frustrating and spoke to\\nsome truth I couldn’t express; my vocabulary was too limited, my words\\ntoo loose a net in which to catch it. Somehow grasping at vanishing\\nsnowflakes is like grasping at happiness: an act of possession that instantly\\ngives way to nothing. It reminded me that there was a world outside this\\nhouse: a world of vastness and unimaginable beauty; a world that, for now,\\nremained out of my reach. That memory has repeatedly returned to me over\\nthe years. It’s as if the misery that surrounded that brief moment of freedom\\nmade it burn even brighter: a tiny light surrounded by darkness.\\nMy only hope of survival, I realized, was to retreat—physically as well\\nas psychically. I had to get away, far away. Only then would I be safe. And\\neventually, at eighteen, I got the grades I needed to secure a place at\\nuniversity. I left that semi-detached prison in Surrey—and I thought I was\\nfree.\\nI was wrong.\\nI didn’t know it then, but it was too late—I had internalized my father,\\nintrojected him, buried him deep in my unconscious. No matter how far I\\nran, I carried him with me wherever I went. I was pursued by an infernal,\\nrelentless chorus of furies, all with his voice—shrieking that I was\\nworthless, shameful, a failure.\\nDuring my first term at university, that first cold winter, the voices got so\\nbad, so paralyzing, they controlled me. Immobilized by fear, I was unable to\\ngo out, socialize, or make any friends. I might as well have never left home.\\nIt was hopeless. I was defeated, trapped. Backed into a corner. No way out.\\nOnly one solution presented itself.\\nI went from chemist to chemist buying packets of paracetamol. I bought\\nonly a few packets at a time to avoid arousing suspicion—but I needn’t\\nhave worried. No one paid me the least attention; I was clearly as invisible\\nas I felt.\\nIt was cold in my room, and my fingers were numb and clumsy as I tore\\nopen the packets. It took an immense effort to swallow all the tablets. But I forced them all down, pill after bitter pill. Then I crawled onto my\\nuncomfortable narrow bed. I shut my eyes and waited for death.\\nBut death didn’t come.\\nInstead a searing, gut-wrenching pain tore through my insides. I doubled\\nup and vomited, throwing up bile and half-digested pills all over myself. I\\nlay in the dark, a fire burning in my stomach, for what seemed like eternity.\\nAnd then, slowly, in the darkness, I realized something.\\nI didn’t want to die. Not yet; not when I hadn’t lived.\\nThis gave me a kind of hope, however murky and ill defined. It propelled\\nme at any rate to acknowledge that I couldn’t do this alone: I needed help.\\nI found it—in the form of Ruth, a psychotherapist referred to me through\\nthe university counseling service. Ruth was white-haired and plump and\\nhad something grandmotherly about her. She had a sympathetic smile—a\\nsmile I wanted to believe in. She didn’t say much at first. She just listened\\nwhile I talked. I talked about my childhood, my home, my parents. As I\\ntalked, I found that no matter how distressing the details I related, I could\\nfeel nothing. I was disconnected from my emotions, like a hand severed\\nfrom a wrist. I talked about painful memories and suicidal impulses—but\\ncouldn’t feel them.\\nI would, however, occasionally look up at Ruth’s face. To my surprise,\\ntears would be collecting in her eyes as she listened. This may seem hard to\\ngrasp, but those tears were not hers.\\nThey were mine.\\nAt the time I didn’t understand. But that’s how therapy works. A patient\\ndelegates his unacceptable feelings to his therapist; and she holds\\neverything he is afraid to feel, and she feels it for him. Then, ever so slowly,\\nshe feeds his feelings back to him. As Ruth fed mine back to me.\\nWe continued seeing each other for several years, Ruth and I. She\\nremained the one constant in my life. Through her, I internalized a new kind\\nof relationship with another human being: one based on mutual respect,\\nhonesty, and kindness—not recrimination, anger, and violence. I slowly\\nstarted to feel differently inside about myself—less empty, more capable of\\nfeeling, less afraid. The hateful internal chorus never entirely left me—but I\\nnow had Ruth’s voice to counter it, and I paid less attention. As a result, the\\nvoices in my head grew quieter and would temporarily vanish. I’d feel\\npeaceful—even happy, sometimes. Psychotherapy had quite literally saved my life. More important, it had\\ntransformed the quality of that life. The talking cure was central to who I\\nbecame—in a profound sense, it defined me.\\nIt was, I knew, my vocation.\\nAfter university, I trained as a psychotherapist in London. Throughout\\nmy training, I continued seeing Ruth. She remained supportive and\\nencouraging, although she warned me to be realistic about the path I was\\nundertaking: “It’s no walk in the park” was how she put it. She was right.\\nWorking with patients, getting my hands dirty—well, it proved far from\\ncomfortable.\\nI remember my first visit to a secure psychiatric unit. Within a few\\nminutes of my arrival, a patient had pulled down his pants, squatted, and\\ndefecated in front of me. A stinking pile of shit. And subsequent incidents,\\nless stomach-churning but just as dramatic—messy botched suicides,\\nattempts at self-harm, uncontained hysteria and grief—all felt more than I\\ncould bear. But each time, somehow, I drew on hitherto untapped resilience.\\nIt got easier.\\nIt’s odd how quickly one adapts to the strange new world of a psychiatric\\nunit. You become increasingly comfortable with madness—and not just the\\nmadness of others, but your own. We’re all crazy, I believe, just in different\\nways.\\nWhich is why—and how—I related to Alicia Berenson. I was one of the\\nlucky ones. Thanks to a successful therapeutic intervention at a young age, I\\nwas able to pull back from the brink of psychic darkness. In my mind,\\nhowever, the other narrative remained forever a possibility: I might have\\ngone crazy—and ended my days locked in an institution, like Alicia. There\\nbut for the grace of God …\\nI couldn’t say any of this to Indira Sharma when she asked why I became\\na psychotherapist. It was an interview panel, after all—and if nothing else, I\\nknew how to play the game.\\n“In the end,” I said, “I believe the training makes you into a\\npsychotherapist. Regardless of your initial intentions.”\\nIndira nodded sagely. “Yes, quite right. Very true.”\\nThe interview went well. My experience of working at Broadmoor gave\\nme an edge, Indira said—demonstrating I could cope with extreme\\npsychological distress. I was offered the job on the spot, and I accepted.\\nOne month later, I was on my way to the Grove. CHAPTER FOUR\\nI ARRIVED AT THE GROVE pursued by an icy January wind. The bare trees\\nstood like skeletons along the road. The sky was white, heavy with snow\\nthat had yet to fall.\\nI stood outside the entrance and reached for my cigarettes in my pocket. I\\nhadn’t smoked in over a week—I’d promised myself that this time I meant\\nit, I’d quit for good. Yet here I was, already giving in. I lit one, feeling\\nannoyed with myself. Psychotherapists tend to view smoking as an\\nunresolved addiction—one that any decent therapist should have worked\\nthrough and overcome. I didn’t want to walk in reeking of cigarettes, so I\\npopped a couple of mints into my mouth and chewed them while I smoked,\\nhopping from foot to foot.\\nI was shivering—but if I’m honest, it was more with nerves than cold. I\\nwas having doubts. My consultant at Broadmoor had made no bones about\\nsaying I was making a mistake. He hinted a promising career was being cut\\nshort by my departure, and he was sniffy about the Grove, and Professor\\nDiomedes in particular.\\n“An unorthodox man. Does a lot of work with group relations—worked\\nwith Foulkes for a while. Ran some kind of alternative therapeutic\\ncommunity in the eighties in Hertfordshire. Not economically viable, those\\nmodels of therapy, especially today…” He hesitated a second, then went on\\nin a lower voice, “I’m not trying to scare you, Theo. But I’ve heard\\nrumblings about that place getting axed. You could find yourself out of a\\njob in six months.… Are you sure you won’t reconsider?”\\nI hesitated, but only out of politeness. “Quite sure.”\\nHe shook his head. “Seems like career suicide to me. But if you’ve made\\nyour decision…”\\nI didn’t tell him about Alicia Berenson, about my desire to treat her. I\\ncould have put it in terms he might understand: working with her might lead\\nto a book or publication of some kind. But I knew there was little point; he’d still say I was making a mistake. Perhaps he was right. I was about to\\nfind out.\\nI stubbed out my cigarette, banished my nerves, and went inside.\\nThe Grove was located in the oldest part of Edgware hospital. The\\noriginal redbrick Victorian building had long since been surrounded and\\ndwarfed by larger, and generally uglier, additions and extensions. The\\nGrove lay in the heart of this complex. The only hint of its dangerous\\noccupants was the line of security cameras perched on the fences like\\nwatching birds of prey. In reception, every effort had been made to make it\\nappear friendly—large blue couches, crude, childish artwork by the patients\\ntaped to the walls. It looked to me more like a kindergarten than a secure\\npsychiatric unit.\\nA tall man appeared at my side. He grinned at me and held out his hand.\\nHe introduced himself as Yuri, head psychiatric nurse. “Welcome to the\\nGrove. Not much of a welcoming committee, I’m afraid. Just me.”\\nYuri was good-looking, well built, and in his late thirties. He had dark\\nhair and a tribal tattoo creeping up his neck, above his collar. He smelled of\\ntobacco and too much sweet aftershave.\\nAlthough he spoke with an accent, his English was perfect. “I moved\\nhere from Latvia seven years ago, and I didn’t speak a word of English\\nwhen I arrived. But in a year I was fluent.”\\n“That’s very impressive.”\\n“Not really. English is an easy language. You should try Latvian.”\\nHe laughed and reached for the jangling chain of keys around his belt. He\\npulled off a set and handed it to me. “You’ll need these for the individual\\nrooms. And there are codes you need to know for the wards.”\\n“That’s a lot. I had fewer keys at Broadmoor.”\\n“Yeah, well. We stepped up security quite a bit recently—since Stephanie\\njoined us.”\\n“Who’s Stephanie?”\\nYuri didn’t reply, but nodded at the woman emerging from the office\\nbehind the reception desk.\\nShe was Caribbean, in her midforties, with a sharp, angular bob. “I’m\\nStephanie Clarke. Manager of the Grove.”\\nStephanie gave me an unconvincing smile. As I shook her hand, I noticed\\nher grip was firmer and tighter than Yuri’s, and rather less welcoming. “As manager of this unit, safety is my top priority. Both the safety of the\\npatients, and of the staff. If you aren’t safe, then neither are your patients.”\\nShe handed me a small device—a personal attack alarm. “Carry this with\\nyou at all times. Don’t just leave it in your office.”\\nI resisted the inclination to say, Yes, ma’am. Better keep on the right side\\nof her if I wanted an easy life. That had been my tactic with previous bossy\\nward managers—avoid confrontation and keep under their radar.\\n“Good to meet you, Stephanie.” I smiled.\\nStephanie nodded but didn’t smile back. “Yuri will show you to your\\noffice.” She turned and marched off without a second glance.\\n“Follow me,” Yuri said.\\nI went with him to the ward entrance—a large reinforced steel door. Next\\nto it, a metal detector was manned by a security guard.\\n“I’m sure you know the drill,” Yuri said. “No sharp objects—nothing that\\ncould be used as a weapon.”\\n“No lighters,” added the security guard as he frisked me, fishing my\\nlighter from my pocket with an accusing look.\\n“Sorry. I forgot I had it.”\\nYuri beckoned me to follow him. “I’ll show you to your office.\\nEveryone’s in the Community meeting, so it’s pretty quiet.”\\n“Can I join them?”\\n“In Community?” Yuri looked surprised. “You don’t want to settle in\\nfirst?”\\n“I can settle in later. If it’s all the same to you?”\\nHe shrugged. “Whatever you want. This way.”\\nHe led me down interconnecting corridors punctuated by locked doors—\\na rhythm of slams and bolts and keys turning in locks. We made slow\\nprogress.\\nIt was obvious not much had been spent on the upkeep of the building in\\nseveral years: paint was crawling away from the walls, and a faint musty\\nsmell of mildew and decay permeated the corridors.\\nYuri stopped outside a closed door and nodded. “They’re in there. Go\\nahead.”\\n“Okay, thanks.”\\nI hesitated, preparing myself. Then I opened the door and went inside. CHAPTER FIVE\\nCOMMUNITY WAS HELD IN A LONG ROOM with tall barred windows that\\noverlooked a redbrick wall. The smell of coffee was in the air, mingled with\\ntraces of Yuri’s aftershave. About thirty people were sitting in a circle. Most\\nwere clutching paper cups of tea or coffee, yawning and doing their best to\\nwake up. Some, having drunk their coffees, were fidgeting with the empty\\ncups, crumpling, flattening them, or tearing them to shreds.\\nCommunity met once or twice daily; it was something between an\\nadministrative meeting and a group therapy session. Items relating to the\\nrunning of the unit or the patients’ care were put on the agenda to be\\ndiscussed. It was, Professor Diomedes was fond of saying, an attempt to\\ninvolve the patients in their own treatment and encourage them to take\\nresponsibility for their well-being, although this attempt didn’t always\\nwork. Diomedes’s background in group therapy meant he had a fondness\\nfor meetings of all kinds, and he encouraged as much group work as\\npossible. You might say he was happiest with an audience. He had the faint\\nair of a theatrical impresario, I thought, as he rose to his feet to greet me,\\nhands outstretched in welcome, and beckoned me over.\\n“Theo. There you are. Join us, join us.”\\nHe spoke with a slight Greek accent, barely detectable—he’d mostly lost\\nit, having lived in England for over thirty years. He was handsome, and\\nalthough in his sixties, he looked much younger—he had a youthful,\\nmischievous manner, more like an irreverent uncle than a psychiatrist. This\\nisn’t to say he wasn’t devoted to the patients in his care—he arrived before\\nthe cleaners did in the morning and stayed long after the night team had\\ntaken over from the day staff, sometimes spending the night on the couch in\\nhis office. Twice divorced, Diomedes was fond of saying his third and most\\nsuccessful marriage was to the Grove.\\n“Sit down here.” He gestured to an empty chair by his side. “Sit, sit, sit.”\\nI did as he asked. Diomedes presented me with a flourish. “Allow me to introduce our new\\npsychotherapist. Theo Faber. I hope you will join me in welcoming Theo to\\nour little family—”\\nWhile Diomedes spoke, I glanced around the circle, looking for Alicia.\\nBut couldn’t see her anywhere. Apart from Professor Diomedes,\\nimpeccably dressed in suit and tie, the others were mostly in short-sleeved\\nshirts or T-shirts. It was hard to tell who was a patient and who was a\\nmember of staff.\\nA couple of faces were familiar to me—Christian, for instance. I had\\nknown him at Broadmoor. A rugby-playing psychiatrist with a broken nose\\nand a dark beard. Good-looking in a bashed-up kind of way. He’d left\\nBroadmoor soon after I arrived. I didn’t like Christian much, but to be fair I\\nhadn’t known him well, as we didn’t work together for long.\\nI remembered Indira, from the interview. She smiled at me, and I was\\ngrateful, for hers was the only friendly face. The patients mostly glared at\\nme with surly mistrust. I didn’t blame them. The abuses they had suffered—\\nphysical, psychological, sexual—meant it would be a long time before they\\ncould trust me, if ever. The patients were all women—and most had course\\nfeatures, lined, scarred. They’d had difficult lives, suffering from horrors\\nthat had driven them to retreat into the no-man’s-land of mental illness;\\ntheir journey was etched into their faces, impossible to miss.\\nBut Alicia Berenson? Where was she? I looked around the circle again\\nbut still couldn’t find her. Then I realized—I was looking right at her. Alicia\\nwas sitting directly opposite me, across the circle.\\nI hadn’t seen her because she was invisible.\\nAlicia was slumped forward in the chair. She was obviously highly\\nsedated. She was holding a paper cup, full of tea, and her trembling hand\\nwas spilling a steady stream of it onto the floor. I restrained myself from\\ngoing over and straightening her cup. She was so out of it I doubt she’d\\nhave noticed if I had.\\nI hadn’t expected her to be in such bad shape. There were some echoes of\\nthe beautiful woman she had once been: deep blue eyes; a face of perfect\\nsymmetry. But she was too thin and looked unclean. Her long red hair was\\nhanging in a dirty, tangled mess around her shoulders. Her fingernails were\\nchewed and torn. Faded scars were visible on both her wrists—the same\\nscars I’d seen faithfully rendered in the Alcestis portrait. Her fingers didn’t\\nstop trembling, doubtless a side effect of the drug cocktail she was on— risperidone and other heavyweight antipsychotics. And glistening saliva\\nwas collecting around her open mouth, uncontrollable drooling being\\nanother unfortunate side effect of the medication.\\nI noticed Diomedes looking at me. I pulled my attention away from\\nAlicia and focused on him.\\n“I’m sure you can introduce yourself better than I can, Theo,” he said.\\n“Won’t you say a few words?”\\n“Thank you.” I nodded. “I don’t really have anything to add. Just that I’m\\nvery happy to be here. Excited, nervous, hopeful. And I’m looking forward\\nto getting to know everyone—particularly the patients. I—”\\nI was interrupted by a sudden bang as the door was thrown open. At first\\nI thought I was seeing things. A giant charged into the room, holding two\\njagged wooden spikes, which she raised high above her head and then threw\\nat us like spears. One of the patients covered her eyes and screamed.\\nI half expected the spears to impale us, but they landed with some force\\non the floor in the middle of the circle. Then I saw they weren’t spears at\\nall. It was a pool cue, snapped in two.\\nThe massive patient, a dark-haired Turkish woman in her forties,\\nshouted, “Pisses me off. Pool cue’s been broke a week and you still ain’t\\nfucking replaced it.”\\n“Watch your language, Elif,” said Diomedes. “I’m not prepared to\\ndiscuss the matter of the pool cue until we decide whether it’s appropriate to\\nallow you to join Community at such a late juncture.” He turned his head\\nslyly and threw the question at me. “What do you think, Theo?”\\nI blinked and took a second to find my voice. “I think it’s important to\\nrespect time boundaries and arrive on time for Community—”\\n“Like you did, you mean?” said a man across the circle.\\nI turned and saw it was Christian who had spoken. He laughed, amused\\nby his own joke.\\nI forced a smile and turned back to Elif. “He’s quite right, I was also late\\nthis morning. So maybe it’s a lesson we can learn together.”\\n“What you on about?” Elif said. “Who the fuck are you anyway?”\\n“Elif. Mind your language,” said Diomedes. “Don’t make me put you on\\ntime-out. Sit down.”\\nElif remained standing. “And what about the pool cue?”\\nThe question was addressed to Diomedes—and he looked at me, waiting\\nfor me to answer it. “Elif, I can see you’re angry about the pool cue,” I said. “I suspect\\nwhoever broke it was also angry. It raises the question of what we do with\\nanger in an institution like this. How about we stick with that and talk about\\nanger for a moment? Won’t you sit down?”\\nElif rolled her eyes. But she sat down.\\nIndira nodded, looking pleased. We started talking about anger, Indira\\nand I, trying to draw the patients into a discussion about their angry\\nfeelings. We worked well together, I thought. I could sense Diomedes\\nwatching, evaluating my performance. He seemed satisfied.\\nI glanced at Alicia. And to my surprise, she was looking at me—or at\\nleast in my direction. There was a dim fogginess in her expression—as if it\\nwas a struggle to focus her eyes and see.\\nIf you told me this broken shell had once been the brilliant Alicia\\nBerenson, described by those who knew her as dazzling, fascinating, full of\\nlife—I simply wouldn’t have believed you. I knew then and there I’d made\\nthe right decision in coming to the Grove. All my doubts vanished. I\\nbecame resolved to stop at nothing until Alicia became my patient.\\nThere was no time to waste: Alicia was lost. She was missing.\\nAnd I intended to find her. CHAPTER SIX\\nPROFESSOR DIOMEDES’S OFFICE was in the oldest and most decrepit part of the\\nhospital. There were cobwebs in the corners, and only a couple of the lights\\nin the corridor were working. I knocked at the door, and after a moment’s\\npause I heard his voice from inside.\\n“Come in.”\\nI turned the handle and the door creaked open. I was immediately struck\\nby the smell inside the room. It smelled different from the rest of the\\nhospital. It didn’t smell like antiseptic or bleach; rather bizarrely, it smelled\\nlike an orchestra pit. It smelled of wood, strings and bows, polish, and wax.\\nIt took a moment for my eyes to become accustomed to the gloom, then I\\nnoticed the upright piano against the wall, an incongruous object in a\\nhospital. Twenty-odd metallic music stands gleamed in the shadows, and a\\nstack of sheet music was piled high on a table, an unsteady paper tower\\nreaching for the sky. A violin was on another table, next to an oboe, and a\\nflute. And beside it, a harp—a huge thing with a beautiful wooden frame\\nand a shower of strings.\\nI stared at it all openmouthed.\\nDiomedes laughed. “You’re wondering about the instruments?” He sat\\nbehind his desk, chuckling.\\n“Are they yours?”\\n“They are. Music is my hobby. No, I lie—it is my passion.” He pointed\\nhis finger in the air dramatically. The professor had an animated way of\\nspeaking, employing a wide range of hand gestures to accompany and\\nunderscore his speech—as if he were conducting an invisible orchestra. “I\\nrun an informal musical group, open to whoever wishes to join—staff and\\npatients alike. I find music to be a most effective therapeutic tool.” He\\npaused to recite in a lilting, musical tone, “‘Music hath charms to soothe a\\nsavage breast.’ Do you agree?”\\n“I’m sure you’re right.” “Hmm.” Diomedes peered at me for a moment. “Do you play?”\\n“Play what?”\\n“Anything. A triangle is a start.”\\nI shook my head. “I’m not very musical. I played the recorder a bit at\\nschool when I was young. That was about it.”\\n“Then you can read music? That is an advantage. Good. Choose any\\ninstrument. I will teach you.”\\nI smiled and again shook my head. “I’m afraid I’m not patient enough.”\\n“No? Well, patience is a virtue you would do well to cultivate as a\\npsychotherapist. You know, in my youth, I was undecided whether I should\\nbe a musician, a priest, or a doctor.” Diomedes laughed. “And now I am all\\nthree.”\\n“I suppose that’s true.”\\n“You know”—he switched subjects without even a hint of a pause—“I\\nwas the deciding voice at your interview. The casting vote, so to speak. I\\nspoke strongly in your favor. You know why? I’ll tell you—I saw\\nsomething in you, Theo. You remind me of myself.… Who knows? In a few\\nyears, you might be running this place.” He left the sentence dangling for a\\nmoment, then sighed. “If it’s still here, of course.”\\n“You think it won’t be?”\\n“Who knows? Too few patients, too many staff. We are working in close\\ncooperation with the Trust to see if a more ‘economically viable’ model can\\nbe found. Which means we are being endlessly watched, evaluated—spied\\nupon. How can we possibly do therapeutic work under such conditions?\\nyou might well ask. As Winnicott said, you can’t practice therapy in a\\nburning building.” Diomedes shook his head and looked his age suddenly—\\nexhausted and weary. He lowered his voice and spoke in a conspiratorial\\nwhisper. “I believe the manager, Stephanie Clarke, is in league with them.\\nThe Trust pays her salary, after all. Watch her, and you’ll see what I mean.”\\nI thought Diomedes was sounding a little paranoid, but perhaps that was\\nunderstandable. I didn’t want to say the wrong thing, so I remained\\ndiplomatically silent for a moment. And then—\\n“I want to ask you something. About Alicia.”\\n“Alicia Berenson?” Diomedes gave me a strange look. “What about\\nher?”\\n“I’m curious what kind of therapeutic work is being done with her. Is she\\nin individual therapy?” “No.”\\n“Is there a reason?”\\n“It was tried—and abandoned.”\\n“Why was that? Who saw her? Indira?”\\n“No.” Diomedes shook his head. “I saw Alicia myself, as a matter of\\nfact.”\\n“I see. What happened?”\\nHe shrugged. “She refused to visit me in my office, so I went to see her\\nin her room. During the sessions, she simply sat on her bed and stared out\\nof the window. She refused to speak, of course. She refused to even look at\\nme.” He threw up his hands, exasperated. “I decided the whole thing was a\\nwaste of time.”\\nI nodded. “I suppose … well, I’m wondering about the transference.…”\\n“Yes?” Diomedes peered at me with curiosity. “Go on.”\\n“It’s possible, isn’t it, that she experienced you as an authoritarian\\npresence … perhaps—potentially punitive? I don’t know what her\\nrelationship with her father was like, but…”\\nDiomedes listened with a small smile, as if he were being told a joke and\\nanticipating the punch line. “But you think she might find it easier to relate\\nto someone younger? Let me guess.… Someone like you? You think you\\ncan help her, Theo? You can rescue Alicia? Make her talk?”\\n“I don’t know about rescuing her, but I’d like to help her. I’d like to try.”\\nDiomedes smiled, still with the same sense of amusement. “You are not\\nthe first. I believed I would succeed. Alicia is a silent siren, my boy, luring\\nus to the rocks, where we dash our therapeutic ambition to pieces.” He\\nsmiled again. “She taught me a valuable lesson in failure. Perhaps you need\\nto learn the same lesson.”\\nI met his gaze defiantly. “Unless, of course, I succeed.”\\nDiomedes’s smile vanished, replaced by something harder to read. He\\nremained silent for a moment, then made a decision.\\n“We’ll see, shall we? First, you must meet Alicia. You’ve not been\\nintroduced to her yet, have you?”\\n“Not yet, no.”\\n“Then ask Yuri to arrange it, will you? Report back to me afterwards.”\\n“Good.” I tried to conceal my excitement. “I will.” CHAPTER SEVEN\\nTHE THERAPY ROOM WAS A SMALL, narrow rectangle; as bare as a prison cell,\\nor barer. The window was closed and barred. A bright pink box of tissues\\non the small table struck a discordantly cheerful note—presumably it was\\nplaced there by Indira: I couldn’t imagine Christian offering tissues to his\\npatients.\\nI sat on one of two battered, faded armchairs. The minutes passed. No\\nsign of Alicia. Perhaps she wasn’t coming? Perhaps she had refused to meet\\nme. She would be perfectly within her rights.\\nImpatient, anxious, nervous, I abandoned sitting and jumped up and\\nwalked to the window. I peered out between the bars.\\nThe courtyard was three stories below me. The size of a tennis court, it\\nwas surrounded by tall redbrick walls, walls that were too high to climb,\\nthough doubtless some had tried. Patients were herded outside for thirty\\nminutes of fresh air every afternoon, whether they wanted it or not, and in\\nthis freezing weather I didn’t blame them for resisting. Some stood alone,\\nmuttering to themselves, or they paced back and forth, like restless\\nzombies, going nowhere. Others huddled in groups, talking, smoking,\\narguing. Voices and shouts and strange excitable laughter floated up to me.\\nI couldn’t see Alicia at first. Then I located her. She was standing alone at\\nthe far end of the courtyard, by the wall. Perfectly still, like a statue. Yuri\\nwalked across the courtyard toward her. He spoke to the nurse standing a\\nfew feet away. The nurse nodded. Yuri went up Alicia cautiously, slowly, as\\nyou might approach an unpredictable animal.\\nI had asked him not to go into too much detail, merely to tell Alicia the\\nnew psychotherapist at the unit would like to meet her. I requested he\\nphrase it as a request, not a demand. Alicia stood still as he spoke to her.\\nBut she neither nodded nor shook her head nor gave any indication of\\nhaving heard him. After a brief pause, Yuri turned and walked off. Well, that’s it, I thought—she won’t come. Fuck it, I should have known.\\nThe whole thing has been a waste of time.\\nThen, to my surprise, Alicia took a step forward. Faltering a little, she\\nshuffled after Yuri across the courtyard—until they disappeared from view\\nunder my window.\\nSo she was coming. I tried to contain my nerves and prepare myself. I\\ntried to silence the negative voice in my head—my father’s voice—telling\\nme I wasn’t up to the job, I was useless, a fraud. Shut up, I thought, shut up,\\nshut up—\\nA couple of minutes later, there was a knock at the door.\\n“Come in.”\\nThe door opened. Alicia was standing with Yuri in the corridor. I looked\\nat her. But she didn’t look at me; her gaze remained downcast.\\nYuri gave me a proud smile. “She’s here.”\\n“Yes. I can see that. Hello, Alicia.”\\nShe didn’t respond.\\n“Won’t you come in?”\\nYuri leaned forward as if to nudge her, but he didn’t actually touch her.\\nInstead he whispered, “Go on, honey. Go in and take a seat.”\\nAlicia hesitated. She glanced at him, then made a decision. She walked\\ninto the room, slightly unsteadily. She sat on a chair, silent as a cat, her\\ntrembling hands in her lap.\\nI was about to shut the door, but Yuri didn’t leave. I lowered my voice. “I\\ncan take it from here, thanks.”\\nYuri looked worried. “But she’s on one-on-one. And the professor said\\n—”\\n“I’ll take full responsibility. It’s quite all right.” I took my personal attack\\nalarm out of my pocket. “See, I have this—but I won’t need it.”\\nI glanced at Alicia. She gave no indication she had even heard me.\\nYuri shrugged, obviously unhappy. “I’ll be on the other side of the door,\\njust in case you need me.”\\n“That’s not necessary, but thanks.”\\nYuri left, and I closed the door. I placed the alarm on the desk. I sat\\nopposite Alicia. She didn’t look up. I studied her for a moment. Her face\\nwas expressionless, blank. A medicated mask. I wondered what lay\\nbeneath. “I’m glad you agreed to see me.” I waited for a response. I knew there\\nwouldn’t be one. “I have the advantage of knowing more about you than\\nyou do about me. Your reputation precedes you—your reputation as a\\npainter, I mean. I’m a fan of your work.” No reaction. I shifted in my seat\\nslightly. “I asked Professor Diomedes if we might talk, and he kindly\\narranged this meeting. Thank you for agreeing to it.”\\nI hesitated, hoping for an acknowledgment of some kind—a blink, a nod,\\na frown. Nothing came. I tried to guess what she was thinking. Perhaps she\\nwas too drugged up to think anything at all.\\nI thought of my old therapist, Ruth. What she would do? She used to say\\nwe are made up of different parts, some good, some bad, and that a healthy\\nmind can tolerate this ambivalence and juggle both good and bad at the\\nsame time. Mental illness is precisely about a lack of this kind of\\nintegration—we end up losing contact with the unacceptable parts of\\nourselves. If I was to help Alicia, we would have to locate the parts she had\\nhidden from herself, beyond the fringes of consciousness, and connect the\\nvarious dots in her mental landscape. Only then could we put into context\\nthe terrible events of that night she killed her husband. It would be a slow,\\nlaborious process.\\nNormally when beginning with a patient, there is no sense of urgency, no\\npredetermined therapeutic agenda. Normally we start with many months of\\ntalking. In an ideal world, Alicia would tell me about herself, her life, her\\nchildhood. I would listen, slowly building up a picture until it was complete\\nenough for me to make accurate, helpful interpretations. In this case, there\\nwould be no talking. No listening. The information I needed would have to\\nbe gathered through nonverbal clues, such as my countertransference—the\\nfeelings Alicia engendered in me during the sessions—and whatever\\ninformation I could gather from other sources.\\nIn other words, I had set into motion a plan to help Alicia without\\nactually knowing how to execute it. Now I had to deliver, not just to prove\\nmyself to Diomedes, but, far more important, to do my duty to Alicia: to\\nhelp her.\\nLooking at her sitting opposite me, in a medicated haze, drool collecting\\naround her mouth, fingers fluttering like dirty moths, I experienced a\\nsudden and unexpected wrench of sadness. I felt desperately sorry for her,\\nand those like her—for all of us, all the wounded and the lost. Of course, I said none of this to her. Instead I did what Ruth would have\\ndone.\\nAnd we simply sat in silence. CHAPTER EIGHT\\nI OPENED ALICIA’S FILE ON MY DESK. Diomedes had volunteered it: “You must\\nread my notes. They will help you.”\\nI had no desire to wade through his notes; I already knew what Diomedes\\nthought; I needed to find out what I thought. But nonetheless I accepted it\\npolitely.\\n“Thank you. That will be such a help.”\\nMy office was small and sparsely furnished, tucked away at the back of\\nthe building, by the fire escape. I looked out the window. A little black bird\\nwas pecking at a patch of frozen grass on the ground outside, dispiritedly\\nand without much hope.\\nI shivered. The room was freezing. The small radiator under the window\\nwas broken—Yuri said he’d try to get it fixed, but that my best bet was to\\ntalk to Stephanie or, failing that, bring it up in Community. I felt a sudden\\npang of empathy with Elif and her battle to get the broken pool cue\\nreplaced.\\nI looked through Alicia’s file without much expectation. The majority of\\nthe information I needed was in the online database. Diomedes, however,\\nlike a lot of older staff members, preferred to write his reports by hand and\\n(ignoring Stephanie’s nagging requests to the contrary) continued to do so\\n—hence the dog-eared file in front of me.\\nI flicked through Diomedes’s notes, ignoring his somewhat old-fashioned\\npsychoanalytic interpretations, and focused on the nurses’ handover reports\\nof Alicia’s day-to-day behavior. I read through those reports carefully. I\\nwanted facts, figures, details—I needed to know exactly what I was getting\\ninto, what I’d have to deal with, and if any surprises were in store.\\nThe file revealed little. When she was first admitted, Alicia slashed her\\nwrists twice and self-harmed with whatever she could get her hands on. She\\nwas kept on two-on-one observation for the first six months—meaning two\\nnurses watched over her at all times—which was eventually relaxed to one- on-one. Alicia made no effort to interact with patients or staff, remaining\\nwithdrawn and isolated and for the most part, the other patients had left her\\nalone. If people don’t reply when you speak to them and never initiate\\nconversation, you soon forget they’re there. Alicia had quickly melted into\\nthe background, becoming invisible.\\nOnly one incident stood out. It took place in the canteen, a few weeks\\nafter Alicia’s admission. Elif accused Alicia of taking her seat. What\\nexactly had happened was unclear, but the confrontation escalated rapidly.\\nApparently Alicia became violent—she smashed a plate and tried to slash\\nElif’s throat with the jagged edge. Alicia had to be restrained, sedated, and\\nplaced in isolation.\\nI wasn’t sure why this incident drew my attention. But it didn’t feel right\\nto me. I decided to approach Elif and ask her about it.\\nI tore off a sheet of paper from a pad and reached for my pen. An old\\nhabit, formed at university—something about putting pen to paper helps me\\norganize my mind. I’ve always had difficulty formulating an opinion until\\nI’ve written it down.\\nI began scribbling ideas, notes, goals—devising a plan of attack. To help\\nAlicia, I needed to understand her, and her relationship with Gabriel. Did\\nshe love him? Hate him? What happened to make her kill him? Why had\\nshe refused to speak about the murder—or anything else? No answers, not\\nyet—just questions.\\nI wrote down a word and underlined it: ALCESTIS.\\nThe self-portrait—it was important, somehow, I knew that, and\\nunderstanding why would be central to unlocking this mystery. This\\npainting was Alicia’s sole communication, her only testimony. It was saying\\nsomething I had yet to comprehend. I made a note to revisit the gallery to\\nlook at the painting again.\\nI wrote down another word: CHILDHOOD. If I was to make sense of\\nGabriel’s murder, I needed to understand not only the events of the night\\nAlicia killed him, but also the events of the distant past. The seeds of what\\nhappened in those few minutes when she shot her husband were probably\\nsown years earlier. Murderous rage, homicidal rage, is not born in the\\npresent. It originates in the land before memory, in the world of early\\nchildhood, with abuse and mistreatment, which builds up a charge over the\\nyears, until it explodes—often at the wrong target. I needed to find out how\\nher childhood had shaped her, and if Alicia couldn’t or wouldn’t tell me, I had to find someone who would. Someone who knew Alicia before the\\nmurder, who could help me understand her history, who she was, and how\\nshe ended up this way.\\nIn the file, Alicia’s next of kin was listed as her aunt—Lydia Rose—who\\nbrought her up, following the death of Alicia’s mother in a car accident.\\nAlicia had also been in the car crash, but survived. That trauma must have\\naffected the little girl profoundly. I hoped Lydia would be able to tell me\\nabout it.\\nThe only other contact was Alicia’s lawyer: Max Berenson. Max was\\nGabriel Berenson’s brother. He was perfectly placed to observe their\\nmarriage intimately. Whether Max Berenson would confide in me was\\nanother matter. An unsolicited approach to Alicia’s family by her\\npsychotherapist was unorthodox to say the least. I had a dim feeling\\nDiomedes would not approve. Better not ask his permission, I decided, in\\ncase he refused.\\nAs I look back, this was my first professional transgression in dealing\\nwith Alicia—setting an unfortunate precedent for what followed. I should\\nhave stopped there. But even then it was too late to stop. In many ways my\\nfate was already decided—like in a Greek tragedy.\\nI reached for the phone. I called Max Berenson at his office, using the\\ncontact number listed in Alicia’s file. It rang several times before it was\\nanswered.\\n“The offices of Elliot, Barrow, and Berenson,” said a receptionist with a\\nbad cold.\\n“Mr. Berenson, please.”\\n“May I ask who is calling?”\\n“My name is Theo Faber. I’m a psychotherapist at the Grove. I was\\nwondering if it might be possible to have a word with Mr. Berenson about\\nhis sister-in-law.”\\nThere was a slight pause before she responded. “Oh. I see. Well, Mr.\\nBerenson is out of the office for the rest of the week. He’s in Edinburgh\\nvisiting a client. If you leave your number, I’ll have him call you on his\\nreturn.”\\nI gave her my number and hung up.\\nI dialed the next number in the file—Alicia’s aunt, Lydia Rose.\\nIt was answered on the first ring. An elderly woman’s voice sounded\\nbreathless and rather annoyed. “Yes? What is it?” “Is that Mrs. Rose?”\\n“Who are you?”\\n“I’m calling regarding your niece, Alicia Berenson. I’m a psychotherapist\\nworking at the—”\\n“Fuck off.” She hung up.\\nI frowned to myself.\\nNot a good start. CHAPTER NINE\\nI DESPERATELY NEEDED A CIGARETTE. As I left the Grove, I looked for them in\\nmy coat pockets, but they weren’t there.\\n“Looking for something?”\\nI turned around. Yuri was standing right behind me. I hadn’t heard him\\nand I was a little startled to find him so close.\\n“I found them in the nurses’ station.” He grinned, handing me my pack of\\ncigarettes. “Must have fallen out of your pocket.”\\n“Thanks.” I took them and lit one. I offered him the packet.\\nYuri shook his head. “I don’t smoke. Not cigarettes, anyway.” He\\nlaughed. “You look like you need a drink. Come on, I’ll buy you a pint.”\\nI hesitated. My instinct was to refuse—I had never been one for\\nsocializing with work colleagues. And I doubted Yuri and I had much in\\ncommon. But he probably knew Alicia better than anyone else at the Grove\\n—and his insights might prove useful.\\n“Sure,” I said. “Why not?”\\nWe went to a pub near the station, the Slaughtered Lamb. Dark and\\ndingy, it had seen better days; so had the old men dozing over their half-\\nfinished pints. Yuri got us a couple of beers, and we sat at a table at the\\nback.\\nYuri took a long swig of beer and wiped his mouth. “Well? Tell me about\\nAlicia.”\\n“Alicia?”\\n“How did you find her?”\\n“I’m not sure I did find her.”\\nYuri gave me a quizzical look, then smiled. “She doesn’t want to be\\nfound? Yeah, it’s true. She’s hiding.”\\n“You’re close to her. I can see that.”\\n“I take special care of her. No one knows her like I do, not even Professor\\nDiomedes.” His voice had a boastful note. It annoyed me for some reason—I\\nwondered how well he really knew her, or if he was just bragging.\\n“What do you make of her silence? What do you think it means?”\\nYuri shrugged. “I guess it means she’s not ready to talk. She’ll talk when\\nshe’s ready.”\\n“Ready for what?”\\n“Ready for the truth, my friend.”\\n“And what is that?”\\nYuri cocked his head to one side slightly, studying me. The question that\\ncame out of his mouth surprised me.\\n“Are you married, Theo?”\\nI nodded. “I am, yes.”\\n“Yeah, I thought so. I was married once too. We moved here from Latvia.\\nBut she didn’t fit in like I did. She didn’t make an effort, you know, she\\ndidn’t learn English. Anyway, it wasn’t … I wasn’t happy—but I was in\\ndenial, lying to myself.…” He drained his drink and completed his\\nsentence. “Until I fell in love.”\\n“Presumably you don’t mean with your wife?”\\nYuri laughed and shook his head. “No. A woman who lived near me. A\\nvery beautiful woman. It was love at first sight. I saw her on the street. It\\ntook me a long time to get the courage to talk her. I used to follow her.…\\nI’d watch her sometimes, without her knowing. I’d stand outside her house\\nand look, hoping she would appear at the window.” He laughed.\\nThis story was starting to make me feel uncomfortable. I finished my\\nbeer and glanced at my watch, hoping Yuri would take the hint, but he\\ndidn’t.\\n“One day I tried speaking to her. But she wasn’t interested in me. I tried a\\nfew times, but she told me to stop pestering her.”\\nI didn’t blame her, I thought. I was about to make my excuses, but Yuri\\nkept talking.\\n“It was very hard to accept. I was sure we were meant to be together. She\\nbroke my heart. I got very angry with her. Very mad.”\\n“And what happened?” I was curious despite myself.\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Nothing? You stayed with your wife?”\\nYuri shook his head. “No. It was over with her. But it took falling for this\\nwoman for me to admit it … to face the truth about me and my wife. Sometimes it takes courage, you know, and a long time, to be honest.”\\n“I see. And you think Alicia’s not ready to face the truth about her\\nmarriage? Is that what you’re saying? You may well be right.”\\nYuri shrugged. “And now I’m engaged to a nice girl from Hungary. She\\nworks in a spa. She speaks good English. We’re a good match. We have a\\ngood time.”\\nI nodded and checked my watch again. I picked up my coat. “I have to\\ngo. I’m late to meet my wife.”\\n“Okay, no problem … What’s her name? Your wife?”\\nFor some reason, I didn’t want to tell him. I didn’t want Yuri to know\\nanything about her. But that was stupid.\\n“Kathryn. Her name is Kathryn. But I call her Kathy.”\\nYuri gave me an odd smile. “Let me give you some advice. Go home to\\nyour wife. Go home to Kathy, who loves you.… And leave Alicia behind.” CHAPTER TEN\\nI WENT TO MEET KATHY at the National Theatre café on the South Bank,\\nwhere the performers would often congregate after rehearsal. She was\\nsitting at the back of the café with a couple of fellow actresses, deep in\\nconversation. They looked up at me as I approached.\\n“Are your ears burning, darling?” Kathy said as she kissed me.\\n“Should they be?”\\n“I’m telling the girls all about you.”\\n“Ah. Should I leave?”\\n“Don’t be silly. Sit down—it’s perfect timing. I’ve just got to how we\\nmet.”\\nI sat down, and Kathy continued her story. It was a story she enjoyed\\ntelling. She occasionally glanced in my direction and smiled, as if to\\ninclude me—but the gesture was perfunctory, for this was her tale, not\\nmine.\\n“I was sitting at a bar when he finally showed up. At last, when I’d given\\nup hope of ever finding him—in he walked, the man of my dreams. Better\\nlate than never. I thought I was going to be married by the time I was\\ntwenty-five, you know? By thirty, I was going to have two kids, small dog,\\nbig mortgage. But here I was, thirty-three-ish, and things hadn’t quite gone\\nto plan.” Kathy said this with an arch smile and winked at the girls.\\n“Anyway I was seeing this Australian guy called Daniel. But he didn’t\\nwant to get married or have kids anytime soon, so I knew I was wasting my\\ntime. And we were out one night when suddenly it happened—Mr. Right\\nwalked in.” Kathy looked at me and smiled and rolled her eyes. “With his\\ngirlfriend.”\\nThis part of the story needed careful handling to retain her audience’s\\nsympathy. Kathy and I were both dating other people when we met. Double\\ninfidelity isn’t the most attractive or auspicious start to a relationship,\\nparticularly as we were introduced to each other by our then partners. They knew each other for some reason, I can’t remember the precise details—\\nMarianne had once gone out with Daniel’s flatmate possibly, or the other\\nway around. I don’t remember exactly how we were introduced, but I do\\nremember the first moment I saw Kathy. It was like an electric shock. I\\nremember her long black hair, piercing green eyes, her mouth—she was\\nbeautiful, exquisite. An angel.\\nAt this point in telling the tale, Kathy paused and smiled and reached for\\nmy hand. “Remember, Theo? How we got talking? You said you were\\ntraining to be a shrink. And I said I was nuts—so it was a match made in\\nheaven.”\\nThis got a big laugh from the girls. Kathy laughed too and glanced at me\\nsincerely, anxiously, her eyes searching mine. “No, but … darling …\\nseriously, it was love at first sight. Wasn’t it?”\\nThis was my cue. I nodded and kissed her cheek. “Of course it was. True\\nlove.”\\nThis received a look of approval from her friends. But I wasn’t\\nperforming. She was right, it was love at first sight—well, lust anyway.\\nEven though I was with Marianne that night, I couldn’t keep my eyes off\\nKathy. I watched her from a distance, talking animatedly to Daniel—and\\nthen I saw her lips mouth, Fuck you. They were arguing. It looked heated.\\nDaniel turned and walked out.\\n“You’re being quiet,” Marianne said. “What’s wrong?”\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Let’s go home, then. I’m tired.”\\n“Not yet.” I was only half listening. “Let’s have another drink.”\\n“I want to go now.”\\n“Then go.”\\nMarianne shot me a hurt look, then grabbed her jacket and walked out. I\\nknew there’d be a row the next day, but I didn’t care.\\nI made my way over to Kathy at the bar. “Is Daniel coming back?”\\n“No. How about Marianne?”\\nI shook my head. “No. Would you like another drink?”\\n“Yes, I would.”\\nSo we ordered two more drinks. We stood at the bar, talking. We\\ndiscussed my psychotherapy training, I remember. And Kathy told me\\nabout her stint at drama school—she didn’t stay long, as she signed up with\\nan agent at the end of her first year and had been acting professionally ever since. I imagined, without knowing why, that she was probably rather a\\ngood actress.\\n“Studying wasn’t for me,” she said. “I wanted to get out there and do it—\\nyou know?”\\n“Do what? Act?”\\n“No. Live.” Kathy tilted her head, looking out from under her dark\\nlashes, her emerald-green eyes peering at me mischievously. “So, Theo.\\nHow do you have the patience to keep doing it—studying, I mean?”\\n“Maybe I don’t want to get out there and ‘live.’ Maybe I’m a coward.”\\n“No. If you were a coward, you’d have gone home with your girlfriend.”\\nKathy laughed, a surprisingly wicked laugh.\\nI wanted to grab her and kiss her hard. I’d never experienced such\\noverwhelming physical desire before; I wanted to pull her close, feel her\\nlips and the heat of her body against mine.\\n“I’m sorry,’ she said. ‘I shouldn’t have said that. I always say whatever\\npops into my head. I told you, I’m a bit nuts.”\\nKathy did that a lot, protesting her insanity—“I’m crazy,” “I’m nuts,”\\n“I’m insane”—but I never believed her. She laughed too easily and too\\noften for me to believe she’d ever suffered the kind of darkness I had\\nexperienced. She had a spontaneity, a lightness—she took a delight in living\\nand was endlessly amused by life. Despite her protestations, she seemed the\\nleast crazy person I’d ever known. Around her, I felt more sane.\\nKathy was American. She was born and brought up on the Upper West\\nSide of Manhattan. Her English mother gave Kathy dual citizenship, but\\nKathy didn’t seem even remotely English. She was determinedly, distinctly\\nun-English—not just in the way she spoke, but in the way she saw the\\nworld and how she approached it. Such confidence, such exuberance. I’d\\nnever met anyone like her.\\nWe left the bar, hailed a cab; I gave the address of my flat. We rode the\\nshort journey in silence. When we arrived, she gently pressed her lips to\\nmine. I broke through my reserve and pulled her toward me. We kept\\nkissing as I fumbled with the key to the front door. We were scarcely inside\\nbefore we were undressing, stumbling into the bedroom, falling onto the\\nbed.\\nThat night was the most erotic, blissful night of my life. I spent hours\\nexploring Kathy’s body. We made love all night, until dawn. I remember so\\nmuch white everywhere: white sunlight creeping around the edges of the curtains, white walls, white bedsheets; the whites of her eyes, her teeth, her\\nskin. I’d never known that skin could be so luminous, so translucent: ivory\\nwhite with occasional blue veins visible just beneath the surface, like\\nthreads of color in white marble. She was a statue; a Greek goddess come to\\nlife in my hands.\\nWe lay there wrapped in each other’s arms. Kathy was facing me, her\\neyes so close they were out of focus. I gazed into a hazy green sea. “Well?”\\nshe said.\\n“Well?”\\n“What about Marianne?”\\n“Marianne?”\\nA flicker of a smile. “Your girlfriend.”\\n“Oh, yes. Yes.” I hesitated, unsure. “I don’t know about Marianne. And\\nDaniel?”\\nKathy rolled her eyes. “Forget Daniel. I have.”\\n“Have you really?”\\nKathy responded by kissing me.\\nBefore Kathy left, she took a shower. While she was showering, I phoned\\nMarianne. I wanted to arrange to see her, to tell her face-to-face. But she\\nwas annoyed about the previous night and insisted we have it out then and\\nthere, on the phone. Marianne wasn’t expecting me to break up with her.\\nBut that’s what I did, as gently as I could. She started crying and became\\nupset and angry. I hung up on her. Brutal, yes—and unkind. I’m not proud\\nof that phone call. But it seemed like the only honest action to take. I still\\ndon’t know what I could have done differently.\\n*   *   *\\nOn our first proper date, Kathy and I met at Kew Gardens. It was her idea.\\nShe was astonished I’d never been. “You’re kidding. You’ve never gone\\nto the greenhouses? There’s this big one with all the tropical orchids and\\nthey keep it so hot, it’s like an oven. When I was at drama school, I used to\\ngo and hang out there just to warm up. How about we meet there, after you\\nfinish work?” Then she hesitated, suddenly unsure. “Or is it too far for you\\nto go?”\\n“I’d go further than Kew Gardens for you, darling.”\\n“Idiot.” She kissed me. Kathy was waiting at the entrance when I arrived, in her enormous coat\\nand scarf, waving like an excited child. “Come on, come on, follow me.”\\nShe led me through the frozen mud to the big glass structure that housed\\nthe tropical plants and pushed open the door and charged inside. I followed\\nher and was immediately struck by the sudden rise in temperature, an\\nonslaught of heat. I tore off my scarf and coat.\\nKathy smiled. “See? I told you, it’s like a sauna. Ain’t it great?”\\nWe walked around along the paths, carrying our coats, holding hands,\\nlooking at the exotic flowers.\\nI felt an unfamiliar happiness just being in her company, as though a\\nsecret door had been opened, and Kathy had beckoned me across the\\nthreshold—into a magical world of warmth and light and color, and\\nhundreds of orchids in a dazzling confetti of blues and reds and yellows.\\nI could feel myself thawing in the heat, softening around the edges, like a\\ntortoise emerging into the sun after a long winter’s sleep, blinking and\\nwaking up. Kathy did that for me—she was my invitation to life, one I\\ngrasped with both hands.\\nSo this is it, I remember thinking. This is love.\\nI recognized it without question and knew clearly that I’d never\\nexperienced anything like this before. My previous romantic encounters had\\nbeen brief, unsatisfactory for all concerned. As a student I had summoned\\nup the nerve, aided by a considerable amount of alcohol, to lose my\\nvirginity to a Canadian sociology student called Meredith, who wore sharp\\nmetal braces that cut into my lips as we kissed. A string of uninspired\\nrelationships followed. I never seemed to find the special connection I\\nlonged for. I had believed I was too damaged, too incapable of intimacy.\\nBut now every time I heard Kathy’s contagious giggle, a wave of\\nexcitement ran through me. Through a kind of osmosis, I absorbed her\\nyouthful exuberance, her unself-consciousness and joy. I said yes to her\\nevery suggestion and every whim. I didn’t recognize myself. I liked this\\nnew person, this unafraid man Kathy inspired me to be. We fucked all the\\ntime. I was consumed with lust, perpetually, urgently hungry for her. I\\nneeded to keep touching her; I couldn’t get close enough.\\nKathy moved in with me that December, into my one-bedroom apartment\\nin Kentish Town. The dank, thickly carpeted basement flat had windows,\\nbut with no view. Our first Christmas together, we were determined to do it properly. We bought a tree from the stall by the tube station and dressed it\\nwith a jumble of decorations and lights from the market.\\nI remember vividly the scent of pine needles and wood and candles\\nburning, and Kathy’s eyes staring into mine, sparkling, twinkling like the\\nlights on the tree. I spoke without thinking. The words just came out:\\n“Will you marry me?”\\nKathy stared at me. “What?”\\n“I love you, Kathy. Will you marry me?”\\nKathy laughed. Then, to my joy and amazement, she said, “Yes.”\\nThe next day, we went out and she chose a ring. And the reality of the\\nsituation dawned on me. We were engaged.\\nBizarrely, the first people I thought of were my parents. I wanted to\\nintroduce Kathy to them. I wanted them to see how happy I was, that I had\\nfinally escaped, that I was free. So we got the train to Surrey. In hindsight, it\\nwas a bad idea. Doomed from the start.\\nMy father greeted me with typical hostility. “You look terrible, Theo.\\nYou’re too thin. Your hair is too short. You look like a convict.”\\n“Thanks, Dad. Good to see you too.”\\nMy mother seemed more depressed than usual. Quieter, smaller\\nsomehow, as if she weren’t there. Dad was a heavier presence, unfriendly,\\nglaring, unsmiling. He didn’t take his cold, dark eyes off Kathy the entire\\ntime. It was an uncomfortable lunch. They didn’t seem to like her, nor did\\nthey seem particularly happy for us. I don’t know why I was surprised.\\nAfter lunch, my father disappeared into his study. He didn’t emerge\\nagain. When my mother said goodbye, she held on to me for too long, too\\nclosely, and was unsteady on her feet. I felt desperately sad. When Kathy\\nand I left the house, part of me hadn’t left, I knew, but had remained behind\\n—forever a child, trapped. I felt lost, hopeless, close to tears. Then Kathy\\nsurprised me, as always. She threw her arms around me, pulling me into a\\nhug. “I understand now,” she whispered in my ear. “I understand it all. I\\nlove you so much more now.”\\nShe didn’t explain further. She didn’t need to.\\n*   *   *\\nWe were married in April, in a small registry office off Euston Square. No\\nparents invited. And no God. Nothing religious, at Kathy’s insistence. But I\\nsaid a secret prayer during the ceremony. I silently thanked Him for giving me such unexpected, undeserved happiness. I saw things clearly now, I\\nunderstood His greater purpose. God hadn’t abandoned me during my\\nchildhood, when I had felt so alone and so scared—He had been keeping\\nKathy hidden up His sleeve, waiting to produce her, like a deft magician.\\nI felt such humility and gratitude for every second we spent together. I\\nwas aware how lucky, how incredibly fortunate I was to have such love,\\nhow rare it was, and how others weren’t so lucky. Most of my patients\\nweren’t loved. Alicia Berenson wasn’t.\\nIt’s hard to imagine two women more different than Kathy and Alicia.\\nKathy makes me think of light, warmth, color, and laughter. When I think\\nof Alicia, I think only of depth, of darkness, of sadness.\\nOf silence. PART TWO\\nUnexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive, and will come forth later,\\nin uglier ways.\\n—SIGMUND FREUD CHAPTER ONE\\nAlicia Berenson’s Diary\\nJULY 16\\nI never thought I’d be longing for rain. We’re into our fourth week of the\\nheat wave, and it feels like an endurance test. Each day seems hotter than\\nthe last. It doesn’t feel like England. More like a foreign country—Greece or\\nsomewhere.\\nI’m writing this on Hampstead Heath. The whole park is strewn with red-\\nfaced, semi-naked bodies, like a beach or a battlefield, on blankets or\\nbenches or spread out on the grass. I’m sitting under a tree, in the shade.\\nIt’s six o’clock, and it has started to cool down. The sun is low and red in a\\ngolden sky—the park looks different in this light—darker shadows, brighter\\ncolors. The grass looks like it’s on fire, flickering flames under my feet.\\nI took off my shoes on my way here and walked barefoot. It reminded me of\\nwhen I was little and I’d play outside. It reminded me of another summer,\\nhot like this one—the summer Mum died—playing outside with Paul,\\ncycling on our bikes through golden fields dotted with wild daisies,\\nexploring abandoned houses and haunted orchards. In my memory that\\nsummer lasts forever. I remember Mum and those colorful tops she’d wear,\\nwith the yellow stringy straps, so flimsy and delicate—just like her. She was\\nso thin, like a little bird. She would put on the radio and pick me up and\\ndance me around to pop songs on the radio. I remember how she smelled of\\nshampoo and cigarettes and Nivea hand cream, always with an undertone\\nof vodka. How old was she then? Twenty-eight? Twenty-nine? She was\\nyounger then than I am now.\\nThat’s an odd thought.\\nOn my way here I saw a small bird on the path, lying by the roots of a tree. I\\nthought it must have fallen from its nest. It wasn’t moving and I wondered if it had broken its wings. I stroked its head gently with my finger. It didn’t\\nreact. I nudged it and turned it over—and the underside of the bird was\\ngone, eaten away, leaving a cavity filled with maggots. Fat, white, slippery\\nmaggots … twisting, turning, writhing … I felt my stomach turn—I thought\\nI was going to be sick. It was so foul, so disgusting—deathly.\\nI can’t get it out of my mind.\\nJULY 17\\nI’ve started taking refuge from the heat in an air-conditioned café on the\\nhigh street—Café de l’Artista. It’s icy cold inside, like climbing into a\\nfridge. There’s a table I like by the window, where I sit drinking iced coffee.\\nSometimes I read or sketch or make notes. Mostly I just let my mind drift,\\nluxuriating in the coldness. The beautiful girl behind the counter stands\\nthere looking bored, staring at her phone, checking her watch, and sighing\\nperiodically. Yesterday afternoon, her sighs seemed especially long—and I\\nrealized she was waiting for me to go, so she could close up. I left\\nreluctantly.\\nWalking in this heat feels like wading through mud. I feel worn down,\\nbattered, beaten up by it. We’re not equipped for it, not in this country—\\nGabriel and I don’t have air-conditioning at home—who does? But without\\nit, it’s impossible to sleep. At night we throw off the covers and lie there in\\nthe dark, naked, drenched in sweat. We leave the windows open, but there’s\\nno hint of a breeze. Just hot dead air.\\nI bought an electric fan yesterday. I set it up at the foot of the bed on top of\\nthe chest.\\nGabriel immediately started complaining. “It makes too much noise. We’ll\\nnever sleep.”\\n“We can’t sleep anyway. At least we won’t be lying here in a sauna.”\\nGabriel grumbled, but he fell asleep before I did. I lay there listening to the\\nfan. I like the sound it makes, a gentle whirring. I can shut my eyes and tune\\nin to it and disappear.\\nI’ve been carrying the fan around the house with me, plugging it in and\\nunplugging it as I move around. This afternoon I took it down to the studio at the end of the garden. Having the fan made it just about bearable. But it’s\\nstill too hot to get much work done. I’m falling behind—but too hot to care.\\nI did have a bit of a breakthrough—I finally understood what’s wrong with\\nthe Jesus picture. Why it’s not working. The problem isn’t with the\\ncomposition—Jesus on the cross—the problem is it’s not a picture of Jesus\\nat all. It doesn’t even look like Him—whatever He looked like. Because it’s\\nnot Jesus.\\nIt’s Gabriel.\\nIncredible that I didn’t see it before. Somehow, without intending to, I’ve put\\nGabriel up there instead. It’s his face I’ve painted, his body. Isn’t that\\ninsane? So I must surrender to that—and do what the painting demands of\\nme.\\nI know now that when I have an agenda for a picture, a predetermined idea\\nhow it should turn out, it never works. It remains stillborn, lifeless. But if\\nI’m really paying attention, really aware, I sometimes hear a whispering\\nvoice pointing me in the right direction. And if I give in to it, as an act of\\nfaith, it leads me somewhere unexpected, not where I intended, but\\nsomewhere intensely alive, glorious—and the result is independent of me,\\nwith a life force of its own.\\nI suppose what scares me is giving in to the unknown. I like to know where\\nI’m going. That’s why I always make so many sketches—trying to control\\nthe outcome—no wonder nothing comes to life—because I’m not really\\nresponding to what’s going on in front of me. I need to open my eyes and\\nlook—and be aware of life as it is happening, and not simply how I want it\\nto be. Now I know it’s a portrait of Gabriel, I can go back to it. I can start\\nagain.\\nI’ll ask him to pose for me. He hasn’t sat for me in a long time. I hope he\\nlikes the idea—and doesn’t think it’s sacrilegious or anything.\\nHe can be funny like that sometimes.\\nJULY 18\\nI walked down the hill to Camden market this morning. I’ve not been there\\nin years, not since Gabriel and I went together one afternoon in search of his lost youth. He used to go when he was a teenager, when he and his\\nfriends had been up all night, dancing, drinking, talking. They’d turn up at\\nthe market in the early morning and watch the traders set up their stalls\\nand try and score some grass from the Rastafarian dealers hanging out on\\nthe bridge by Camden Lock. The dealers were no longer there when Gabriel\\nand I went—to Gabriel’s dismay. “I don’t recognize it here anymore,” he\\nsaid. “It’s a sanitized tourist trap.”\\nWalking around today, I wondered if the problem wasn’t that the market had\\nchanged as the fact Gabriel had changed. It’s still populated by sixteen-\\nyear-olds, embracing the sunshine, sprawled on either side of the canal, a\\njumble of bodies—boys in rolled-up shorts with bare chests, girls in bikinis\\nor bras—skin everywhere, burning, reddening flesh. The sexual energy was\\npalpable—their hungry, impatient thirst for life. I felt a sudden desire for\\nGabriel—for his body and his strong legs, his thighs thick lain over mine.\\nWhen we have sex, I always feel an insatiable hunger for him—for a kind of\\nunion between us—something that’s bigger than me, bigger than us, beyond\\nwords—something holy.\\nSuddenly I caught sight of a homeless man, sitting by me on the pavement,\\nstaring at me. His trousers were tied up with string, his shoes held together\\nwith tape. His skin had sores and a bumpy rash across his face. I felt a\\nsudden sadness and revulsion. He stank of stale sweat and urine. For a\\nsecond I thought he spoke to me. But he was just swearing to himself under\\nhis breath—“fucking” this and “fucking” that. I fished for some change in\\nmy bag and gave it to him.\\nThen I walked home, back up the hill, slowly, step by step. It seemed much\\nsteeper now. It took forever in the sweltering heat. For some reason I\\ncouldn’t stop thinking about the homeless man. Apart from pity, there was\\nanother feeling, unnamable somehow—a kind of fear. I pictured him as a\\nbaby in his mother’s arms. Did she ever imagine her baby would end up\\ncrazy, dirty and stinking, huddled on the pavement, muttering obscenities?\\nI thought of my mother. Was she crazy? Is that why she did it? Why she\\nstrapped me into the passenger seat of her yellow mini and sped us toward\\nthat redbrick wall? I always liked that car, its cheerful canary yellow. The\\nsame yellow as in my paint box. Now I hate that color—every time I use it, I\\nthink of death. Why did she do it? I suppose I’ll never know. I used to think it was suicide.\\nNow I think it was attempted murder. Because I was in the car too, wasn’t I?\\nSometimes I think I was the intended victim—it was me she was trying to\\nkill, not herself. But that’s crazy. Why would she want to kill me?\\nTears collected in my eyes as I walked up the hill. I wasn’t crying for my\\nmother—or myself—or even that poor homeless man. I was crying for all of\\nus. There’s so much pain everywhere, and we just close our eyes to it. The\\ntruth is we’re all scared. We’re terrified of each other. I’m terrified of\\nmyself—and of my mother in me. Is her madness in my blood? Is it? Am I\\ngoing to—\\nNo. Stop. Stop—\\nI’m not writing about that. I’m not.\\nJULY 20\\nLast night Gabriel and I went out for dinner. We usually do on Fridays.\\n“Date night” he calls it, in a silly American accent.\\nGabriel always downplays his feelings and makes fun of anything he\\nconsiders “soppy.” He likes to think of himself as cynical and\\nunsentimental. But the truth is he’s a deeply romantic man—in his heart if\\nnot his speech. Actions speak louder than words, don’t they? And Gabriel’s\\nactions make me feel totally loved.\\n“Where do you want to go?” I asked.\\n“Three guesses.”\\n“Augusto’s?”\\n“Got it in one.”\\nAugusto’s is our local Italian restaurant, just down the road. It’s nothing\\nspecial, but it’s our home from home, and we’ve spent many happy evenings\\nthere. We went around eight o’clock. The air-conditioning wasn’t working,\\nso we sat by the open window in the hot, still, humid air and drank chilled\\ndry white wine. I felt quite drunk by the end, and we laughed a lot, at\\nnothing, really. We kissed outside the restaurant and had sex when we came\\nhome. Thankfully, Gabriel has come around to the portable fan, at least when\\nwe’re in bed. I positioned it in front of us, and we lay in the cool breeze,\\nwrapped in each other’s arms. He stroked my hair and kissed me. “I love\\nyou,” he whispered. I didn’t say anything; I didn’t need to. He knows how I\\nfeel.\\nBut I ruined the mood, stupidly, clumsily—by asking if he would sit for me.\\n“I want to paint you,” I said.\\n“Again? You already did.”\\n“That was four years ago. I want to paint you again.”\\n“Uh-huh.” He didn’t look enthusiastic. “What kind of thing do you have in\\nmind?”\\nI hesitated—and then said it was for the Jesus picture. Gabriel sat up and\\ngave a kind of strangled laugh.\\n“Oh, come on, Alicia.”\\n“What?\\n“I don’t know about that, love. I don’t think so.”\\n“Why not?”\\n“Why do you think? Painting me on the cross? What are people going to\\nsay?”\\n“Since when do you care what people say?”\\n“I don’t, not about most things, but—I mean, they might think that’s how\\nyou see me.”\\nI laughed. “I don’t think you’re the son of God, if that’s what you mean. It’s\\njust an image—something that happened organically while I was painting. I\\nhaven’t consciously thought about it.”\\n“Well, maybe you should think about it.”\\n“Why? It’s not a comment on you, or our marriage.”\\n“Then what is it?”\\n“How should I know?” Gabriel laughed at this and rolled his eyes. “All right. Fuck it. If you want.\\nWe can try. I suppose you know what you’re doing.”\\nThat doesn’t sound like much of an endorsement. But I know Gabriel\\nbelieves in me and my talent—I’d never be a painter if it weren’t for him. If\\nhe hadn’t needled and encouraged and bullied me, I’d never have kept\\ngoing during those first few dead years after college, when I was painting\\nwalls with Jean-Felix. Before I met Gabriel, I lost my way, somehow—I lost\\nmyself. I don’t miss those druggy partiers who passed for friends during my\\ntwenties. I only ever saw them at night—they vanished at dawn, like\\nvampires fleeing the light. When I met Gabriel, they faded away into\\nnothing, and I didn’t even notice. I didn’t need them anymore; I didn’t need\\nanyone now I had him. He saved me—like Jesus. Maybe that’s what the\\npainting is about. Gabriel is my whole world—and has been since the day\\nwe met. I’ll love him no matter what he does, or what happens—no matter\\nhow much he upsets me—no matter how untidy or messy he is—how\\nthoughtless, how selfish. I’ll take him just as he is.\\nUntil death do us part.\\nJULY 21\\nToday Gabriel came and sat for me in the studio.\\n“I’m not doing this for days again,” he said. “How long are we talking\\nabout?”\\n“It’s going take more than one session to get it right.”\\n“Is this just a ploy to spend more time together? If so, how about we skip\\nthe preamble and go to bed?”\\nI laughed. “Maybe afterwards. If you’re good and don’t fidget too much.”\\nI positioned him standing in front of the fan. His hair blew in the breeze.\\n“How should I look?” He struck a pose.\\n“Not like that. Just be yourself.”\\n“Don’t you want me to adopt an anguished expression?”\\n“I’m not sure Jesus was anguished. I don’t see him like that. Don’t pull any\\nfaces—just stand there. And don’t move.” “You’re the boss.”\\nHe stood for about twenty minutes. Then he broke the pose, saying he was\\ntired.\\n“Sit down, then. But don’t talk. I’m working on the face.”\\nGabriel sat on a chair and kept quiet while I worked. I enjoyed painting his\\nface. It’s a good face. A strong jaw, high cheekbones, elegant nose. Sitting\\nthere with the spotlight on him, he looked like a Greek statue. A hero of\\nsome kind.\\nBut something was wrong. I don’t know what—maybe I was pushing too\\nhard. I just couldn’t get the shape of his eyes right, nor the color. The first\\nthing I ever noticed about Gabriel was the sparkle in his eyes—like a tiny\\ndiamond in each iris. But now for some reason I couldn’t catch it. Maybe\\nI’m just not skilled enough—or maybe Gabriel has something extra that\\ncan’t be captured in paint. The eyes remained dead, lifeless. I could feel\\nmyself getting annoyed.\\n“Fuck,” I said. “It’s not going well.”\\n“Time for a break?”\\n“Yeah. Time for a break.”\\n“Shall we have sex?”\\nThat made me laugh. “Okay.”\\nGabriel jumped up, took hold of me, and kissed me. We made love in the\\nstudio, there on the floor.\\nThe whole time, I kept glancing at the lifeless eyes in Gabriel’s portrait.\\nThey were staring at me, burning into me. I had to turn away.\\nBut I could still feel them watching. CHAPTER TWO\\nI WENT TO FIND DIOMEDES to report on my meeting with Alicia. He was in his\\noffice, sorting through piles of sheet music.\\n“Well”—he didn’t look up—“how did it go?”\\n“It didn’t, really.”\\nDiomedes gave me a quizzical glance.\\nI hesitated. “If I’m going to get anywhere with her, I need Alicia to be\\nable to think, and feel.”\\n“Absolutely. And your concern is…?”\\n“It’s impossible to get through to someone when they’re so heavily\\nmedicated. It’s like she’s six feet underwater.”\\nDiomedes frowned. “I wouldn’t go that far. I’m not familiar with the\\nexact dose she’s on—”\\n“I checked with Yuri. Sixteen milligrams of risperidone. A horse’s dose.”\\nDiomedes raised an eyebrow. “That’s certainly quite high, yes. It could\\nprobably be reduced. You know, Christian is the head of Alicia’s care team.\\nYou should talk to him about it.”\\n“I think it’ll sound better coming from you.”\\n“Hmm.” Diomedes gave me a doubtful look. “You and Christian knew\\neach other before, didn’t you? At Broadmoor?”\\n“Very slightly.”\\nDiomedes didn’t respond immediately. He reached over to a little dish of\\nsugared almonds on his desk and offered me one.\\nI shook my head.\\nHe popped an almond in his mouth and crunched it, watching me as he\\nchewed. “Tell me, is everything friendly between you and Christian?”\\n“That’s an odd question. Why do you ask?”\\n“Because I’m picking up on some hostility.”\\n“Not on my part.”\\n“But on his?” “You’ll have to ask him. I have no problem with Christian.”\\n“Hmm. Perhaps I’m imagining it. But I’m sensing something.… Keep an\\neye on it. Any aggression or competitiveness interferes with the work. You\\ntwo need to work with each other, not against each other.”\\n“I’m aware of that.”\\n“Well, Christian needs to be included in this discussion. You want Alicia\\nto feel, yes. But remember, with greater feeling comes greater danger.”\\n“Danger for whom?”\\n“For Alicia, of course.” Diomedes wagged his finger at me. “Don’t forget\\nshe was highly suicidal when we first brought her here. She made numerous\\nattempts to end her life. And the medication keeps her stable. It keeps her\\nalive. If we lower the dose, there’s every chance she will be overwhelmed\\nby her feelings and be unable to cope. Are you prepared to take that risk?”\\nI took what Diomedes said seriously. But I nodded. “It’s a risk I believe\\nwe need to take, Professor. Otherwise we’ll never reach her.”\\nDiomedes shrugged. “Then I shall talk to Christian on your behalf.”\\n“Thank you.”\\n“We’ll see how he reacts. Psychiatrists don’t often respond well to being\\ntold how to medicate their patients. Of course, I can overrule him, but I\\ndon’t tend to do that—let me broach the subject with him subtly. I’ll tell\\nyou what he says.”\\n“It might be better not to mention me when you talk to him.”\\n“I see.” Diomedes smiled strangely. “Very well, I won’t.”\\nHe pulled out a little box from his desk, sliding off the cover to reveal a\\nrow of cigars. He offered me one. I shook my head.\\n“You don’t smoke?” He seemed surprised. “You look like a smoker to\\nme.”\\n“No, no. Only the occasional cigarette—just now and then … I’m trying\\nto quit.”\\n“Good, good for you.” He opened the window. “You know that joke,\\nabout why you can’t be a therapist and smoke? Because it means you’re\\nstill fucked-up.” He laughed and popped one of the cigars into his mouth. “I\\nthink we’re all a bit crazy in this place. You know that sign they used to\\nhave in offices? ‘You don’t need to be mad to work here, but it helps’?”\\nDiomedes laughed again. He lit the cigar and puffed on it, blowing the\\nsmoke outside. I watched him enviously. CHAPTER THREE\\nAFTER LUNCH I PROWLED THE CORRIDORS, looking for an exit. I was intending\\nto sneak outside and have a cigarette, but I was discovered by Indira by the\\nfire escape. She assumed I was lost.\\n“Don’t worry, Theo,” she said, taking my arm. “It took me months to get\\nmy bearings around here. Like a maze with no way out. I still get lost\\nsometimes and I’ve been here ten years.” She laughed. Before I could\\nobject, she was guiding me upstairs for a cup of tea in the “goldfish bowl.”\\n“I’ll put the kettle on. Bloody miserable weather, isn’t it? I wish it would\\njust snow and get it over with.… Snow is a very powerful imaginative\\nsymbol, don’t you think? Wipes everything clean. Have you noticed how\\nthe patients keep talking about it? Look out for it. It’s interesting.”\\nTo my surprise, she reached into her bag and pulled out a thick slice of\\ncake wrapped in cling film. She thrust it into my hand. “Take it. Walnut\\ncake. I made it last night. For you.”\\n“Oh, thank you, I—”\\n“I know it’s unorthodox, but I always get better results with difficult\\npatients if I give them a slice of cake in the session.”\\nI laughed. “I bet you do. Am I a difficult patient?”\\nIndira laughed. “No, although I find it works just as well on difficult\\nmembers of staff too—which you’re not either, by the way. A little bit of\\nsugar is a great mood enhancer. I used to make cakes for the canteen, but\\nthen Stephanie made such a fuss, all this health-and-safety nonsense about\\nfood being brought in from the outside. You’d think I was smuggling in a\\nfile. But I still bake a little on the sly. My rebellion against the dictator state.\\nTry it.”\\nThis was not a question but a command. I took a bite. It was good.\\nChewy, nutty, sweet. My mouth was full, so I covered it with my hand as I\\nspoke.\\n“I think this will definitely put your patients in a good mood.” Indira laughed and looked pleased. I realized why I liked her—she\\nradiated a kind of maternal calm. She reminded me of my old therapist,\\nRuth. It was hard to imagine her ruffled, or upset.\\nI glanced around the room as she made the tea. The nurses’ station is\\nalways the hub of a psychiatric unit, its heart: staff flow to and from it, and\\nit is where the ward is run from day to day; at least where all the practical\\ndecisions are made. The goldfish bowl was the nurses’ nickname for the\\nstation, as its walls were made of reinforced glass—meaning staff could\\nkeep an eye on the patients in the recreation room, in theory at least. In\\npractice, the patients hovered restlessly outside, staring in, watching us, so\\nwe were the ones under constant observation. The small space did not have\\nenough chairs, and the ones that were there were generally occupied by\\nnurses typing up notes. So you mostly stood in the middle of the room or\\nleaned awkwardly against a desk, which gave the space a crowded feel, no\\nmatter how many people were in it.\\n“Here you are, love.” Indira handed me a mug of tea.\\n“Thanks.”\\nChristian ambled in and nodded at me. He smelled strongly of the\\npeppermint gum he was always chewing. I remembered he used to smoke\\nheavily when we were at Broadmoor together; it was one of the few things\\nwe had in common. Since then Christian had quit, got married, and had a\\nbaby daughter. I wondered what kind of father he made. He didn’t strike me\\nas particularly compassionate.\\nHe gave me a cold smile. “Funny seeing you again like this, Theo.”\\n“Small world.”\\n“In mental health terms, it is—yes.” Christian said this as if to imply he\\nmight be found in other, larger worlds. I tried to imagine what they might\\nbe. I could only imagine him in the gym or in a scrum on the rugby field.\\nChristian stared at me for a few seconds. I’d forgotten his habit of\\npausing, often lengthily, making you wait while he considered his response.\\nIt irritated me here just as much as it had done at Broadmoor.\\n“You’re joining the team at rather an unfortunate moment,” he said\\neventually. “The sword of Damocles is hanging over the Grove.”\\n“You think it’s as bad as that?”\\n“It’s only a matter of time. The Trust is bound to shut us down sooner or\\nlater. So the question is, what are you doing here?”\\n“What do you mean?” “Well, rats desert a sinking ship. They don’t clamber on board.”\\nI was startled by Christian’s undisguised aggression. I decided not to rise\\nto the bait. I shrugged. “Possibly. But I’m not a rat.”\\nBefore Christian could reply, a massive thud made us jump. Elif was on\\nthe other side of the glass, hammering at it with her fists. Her face was\\npressed up against it, squashing her nose, distorting her features, making\\nher almost monstrous.\\n“I won’t take this shit no more. I hate this—these fucking pills, man—”\\nChristian opened a small hatch in the glass and spoke through it. “Now is\\nnot the time to discuss this, Elif.”\\n“I’m telling you, I’m not taking them no more, they make me fucking\\nsick—”\\n“I’m not having this conversation now. Make an appointment to see me.\\nStep away, please.”\\nElif scowled, deliberating for a moment. Then she turned and lumbered\\noff, leaving a faint circle of condensation where her nose had been pressed\\nagainst the glass.\\n“Quite a character,” I said.\\nChristian grunted. “Difficult.”\\nIndira nodded. “Poor Elif.”\\n“What’s she in for?”\\n“Double murder,” Christian said. “Killed her mother and her sister.\\nSuffocated them while they slept.”\\nI peered through the glass. Elif joined the other patients. She towered\\nover them. One of them slipped some money into her hand, which she\\npocketed.\\nThen I noticed Alicia at the far end of the room, sitting by herself, by the\\nwindow, looking out. I watched her for a moment.\\nChristian followed my gaze and said, “By the way, I’ve been talking to\\nProfessor Diomedes about Alicia. I want to see how she does on a lower\\ndose of risperidone. I’ve brought her down to five milligrams.”\\n“I see.”\\n“I thought you might want to know—since I heard you saw her for a\\nsession.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“We’ll have to monitor her closely to see how she reacts to the change.\\nAnd, by the way, next time you have a problem with how I medicate my patients, come to me directly. Don’t sneak off to Diomedes behind my\\nback.” Christian glared at me.\\nI smiled back at him. “I didn’t sneak anywhere. I have no problem\\ntalking to you directly, Christian.”\\nThere was an uncomfortable pause. Christian nodded to himself, as if\\nhe’d made his mind up about something. “You do realize Alicia is\\nborderline? She won’t respond to therapy. You’re wasting your time.”\\n“How do you know she’s borderline if she can’t talk?”\\n“Won’t talk.”\\n“You think she’s faking?”\\n“Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.”\\n“If she’s faking, then how can she be borderline?”\\nChristian looked irritated.\\nIndira interrupted before he could reply. “With all due respect, I don’t\\nfeel umbrella terms like borderline are particularly helpful. They don’t tell\\nus anything very useful at all.” She glanced at Christian. “This is a subject\\nChristian and I disagree on frequently.”\\n“And how do you feel about Alicia?” I asked her.\\nIndira pondered the question for a moment. “I find myself feeling very\\nmaternal towards her. That’s my countertransference, that’s what she brings\\nout in me—I feel she needs someone to take care of her.” Indira smiled at\\nme. “And now she has someone. She has you.”\\nChristian laughed that annoying laugh of his. “Forgive me for being so\\ndense, but how can Alicia benefit from therapy if she doesn’t talk?”\\n“Therapy isn’t just about talking,” Indira said. “It’s about providing a\\nsafe space—a containing environment. Most communication is nonverbal,\\nas I’m sure you know.”\\nChristian rolled his eyes at me. “Good luck, mate. You’ll need it.” CHAPTER FOUR\\n“HELLO, ALICIA,” I said.\\nOnly a few days had passed since her medication had been lowered, but\\nthe difference in Alicia was already apparent. She seemed more fluid in her\\nmovements. Her eyes were clearer. The foggy gaze had gone. She seemed\\nlike a different person.\\nShe stood at the door with Yuri and hesitated. She stared at me, as if\\nseeing me clearly for the first time, taking me in, sizing me up. I wondered\\nwhat she was concluding. Evidently she judged it safe to proceed and\\nwalked inside. Without being asked, she sat down.\\nI nodded at Yuri to go. He deliberated for a second, then shut the door\\nbehind him.\\nI sat opposite Alicia. There was silence for a moment. Just the restless\\nsound of the rain outside, raindrops drumming against the window.\\nEventually I spoke.\\n“How are you feeling?”\\nNo response. Alicia stared at me. Eyes like lamps, unblinking.\\nI opened my mouth and closed it again. I was determined to resist the\\nurge to fill the void by talking. Instead, by remaining silent and just sitting\\nthere, I hoped to communicate something else, something nonverbal: that it\\nwas okay for us to sit together like this, that I wouldn’t hurt her, that she\\ncould trust me. To have any success at getting Alicia to talk, I needed to win\\nher trust. And this would take time—nothing would be accomplished\\novernight. It would move slowly, like a glacier, but it would move.\\nAs we sat there in silence, my head started to throb at the temples. The\\nbeginnings of a headache. A telltale symptom. I thought of Ruth, who used\\nto say, “In order to be a good therapist, you must be receptive to your\\npatients’ feelings—but you must not hold on to them—they are not yours—\\nthey do not belong to you.” In other words, this thump, thump, thumping in\\nmy head wasn’t my pain; it belonged to Alicia. And this sudden wave of sadness—this desire to die, die, die—did not belong to me either. It was\\nhers, all hers. I sat there, feeling it for her, my head pounding, my stomach\\nchurning, for what seemed like hours. Eventually, the fifty minutes were up.\\nI looked at my watch. “We have to finish now.”\\nAlicia lowered her head and stared at her lap. I hesitated. I lost control of\\nmy reserve. I lowered my voice and spoke from the heart.\\n“I want to help you, Alicia. I need you to believe that. The truth is, I want\\nto help you to see clearly.”\\nAt this, Alicia looked up. She stared at me—right through me.\\nYou can’t help me, her eyes shouted. Look at you, you can barely help\\nyourself. You pretend to know so much and be so wise, but you should be\\nsitting here instead of me. Freak. Fraud. Liar. Liar—\\nAs she stared at me, I became aware of what had been troubling me the\\nwhole session. It’s hard to put into words, but a psychotherapist quickly\\nbecomes attuned to recognizing mental distress, from physical behavior and\\nspeech and a glint in the eyes—something haunted, afraid, mad. And that’s\\nwhat bothered me: despite the years of medication, despite everything she\\nhad done, and endured, Alicia’s blue eyes remained as clear and cloudless\\nas a summer’s day. She wasn’t mad. So what was she? What was the\\nexpression in her eyes? What was the right word? It was—\\nBefore I could finish the thought, Alicia leaped from the chair. She threw\\nherself toward me, hands outstretched like claws. I had no time to move or\\nget out the way. She landed on top of me, knocking me off-balance. We fell\\nto the floor.\\nThe back of my head hit the wall with a thud. She bashed my head\\nagainst the wall again and again, and started scratching, slapping, clawing\\n—it took all my strength to throw her off.\\nI scrambled along the floor and reached up to the table. I groped for the\\nattack alarm. Just as my fingers grasped it, Alicia jumped on me and\\nknocked the alarm from my hand.\\n“Alicia—”\\nHer fingers were tight around my neck, gripping, choking—I groped for\\nthe alarm but couldn’t reach it. Her hands dug deeper—I couldn’t breathe. I\\nmade another lunge—this time I managed to grab hold of the alarm. I\\npressed it.\\nA wailing scream instantly filled my ears, deafening me. I could hear the\\ndistant sound of a door opening and Yuri calling for backup. Alicia was dragged off me, releasing her choke hold—and I gasped for breath.\\nIt took four nurses to hold Alicia down. She writhed and kicked and\\nfought like a creature possessed. She didn’t seem human, more like a wild\\nanimal; something monstrous. Christian appeared and sedated her. She lost\\nconsciousness.\\nAt last, there was silence. CHAPTER FIVE\\n“THIS WILL STING A BIT.”\\nYuri was tending to my bleeding scratches in the goldfish bowl. He\\nopened the bottle of antiseptic and applied it to a swab. The medicinal odor\\ntransported me to the sick bay at school, conjuring up memories of\\nplayground battle scars, grazed knees and scratched elbows. I remembered\\nthe warm, cozy feeling of being taken care of by Matron, bandaged and\\nrewarded for my bravery with a boiled sweet. Then the sting of the\\nantiseptic on my skin brought me back sharply to the present, where the\\ninjuries I presented were not so easily remedied. I winced.\\n“My head feels like she hit me with a fucking hammer.”\\n“It’s a nasty bruise. You’ll have a lump tomorrow. We’d better keep an\\neye on it.” Yuri shook his head. “I never should have left you alone with\\nher.”\\n“I didn’t give you a choice.”\\nHe grunted. “That’s true enough.”\\n“Thanks for not saying, ‘I told you so.’ It’s noted and appreciated.”\\nYuri shrugged. “I don’t need to, mate. The professor will say it for me.\\nHe’s asked to see you in his office.”\\n“Ah.”\\n“Rather you than me, by the look of him.”\\nI started getting up.\\nYuri watched me carefully. “Don’t rush. Take a minute. Make sure you’re\\nready. Any dizziness or headaches, let me know.”\\n“I’m fine. Honestly.”\\nThat wasn’t strictly true, but I didn’t feel as bad as I looked. Bloody\\nscratches, and black bruises around my throat where she’d tried to strangle\\nme—she’d dug so deep with her fingers, she’d drawn blood.\\nI knocked on the professor’s door. Diomedes’s eyes widened when he\\nsaw me. He tutted. “Po po po. Did you need stitches?” “No, no, of course not. I’m fine.”\\nDiomedes gave me a disbelieving look and ushered me inside. “Come in,\\nTheo. Sit down.”\\nThe others were already there. Christian and Stephanie were standing.\\nIndira was sitting by the window. It felt like a formal reception, and I\\nwondered if I was about to get fired.\\nDiomedes sat behind his desk. He gestured to me to sit in the remaining\\nempty chair. I sat. He stared at me in silence for a moment, drumming his\\nfingers, deliberating what to say, or how to say it. But before he could make\\nup his mind, he was beaten to it by Stephanie.\\n“This is an unfortunate incident. Extremely unfortunate.” She turned to\\nme. “Obviously we’re all relieved you’re still in one piece. But that doesn’t\\nalter the fact that it raises all kinds of questions. And the first is, what were\\nyou doing alone with Alicia?”\\n“It was my fault. I asked Yuri to leave. I take full responsibility.”\\n“On whose authority did you make that decision? If either of you had\\nbeen seriously injured—”\\nDiomedes interrupted. “Please don’t let’s get dramatic. Thankfully\\nneither was hurt.” He gestured at me dismissively. “A few scratches are\\nhardly grounds for a court-martial.”\\nStephanie pulled a face. “I don’t think jokes are really appropriate,\\nProfessor. I really don’t.”\\n“Who’s joking?” Diomedes turned to me. “I’m deadly serious. Tell us,\\nTheo. What happened?”\\nI felt all their eyes on me; I addressed myself to Diomedes. I chose my\\nwords carefully. “Well, she attacked me. That’s what happened.”\\n“That much is obvious. But why? I take it was unprovoked?”\\n“Yes. At least, consciously.”\\n“And unconsciously?”\\n“Well, obviously Alicia was reacting to me on some level. I believe it\\nshows us how much she wants to communicate.”\\nChristian laughed. “You call that communication?”\\n“Yes, I do. Rage is a powerful communication. The other patients—the\\nzombies who just sit there, vacant, empty—they’ve given up. Alicia hasn’t.\\nHer attack tells us something she can’t articulate directly—about her pain,\\nher desperation, her anguish. She was telling me not to give up on her. Not\\nyet.” Christian rolled his eyes. “A less poetic interpretation might be that she\\nwas off her meds and out of her mind.” He turned to Diomedes. “I told you\\nthis would happen, Professor. I warned you about lowering the dose.”\\n“Really, Christian?” I said. “I thought it was your idea.”\\nChristian dismissed me with a roll of his eyes. He was a psychiatrist\\nthrough and through, I thought. By that I mean psychiatrists tend to be wary\\nof psychodynamic thinking. They favor a more biological, chemical, and,\\nabove all, practical approach—such as the cup of pills Alicia was handed at\\nevery meal. Christian’s unfriendly, narrow gaze told me that there was\\nnothing I could contribute.\\nDiomedes, however, eyed me more thoughtfully. “It hasn’t put you off,\\nTheo, what happened?”\\nI shook my head. “On the contrary, I’m encouraged.”\\nDiomedes nodded, looking pleased. “Good. I agree, such an intense\\nreaction to you is certainly worth investigating. I think you should keep\\ngoing.”\\nAt this Stephanie could restrain herself no longer. “That’s absolutely out\\nof the question.”\\nDiomedes kept talking as if she hadn’t spoken. He kept looking at me.\\n“You think you can get her to talk?”\\nBefore I could reply, a voice said from behind me, “I believe he can,\\nyes.”\\nIt was Indira. I’d almost forgotten she was there. I turned around.\\n“And in a way,” Indira said, “Alicia has begun to talk. She’s\\ncommunicating through Theo—he is her advocate. It’s already happening.”\\nDiomedes nodded. He looked pensive for a moment. I knew what was on\\nhis mind—Alicia Berenson was a famous patient, and a powerful\\nbargaining tool with the Trust. If we could make demonstrable progress\\nwith her, we’d have a much stronger hand in saving the Grove from closure.\\n“How long to see results?” Diomedes asked.\\n“I can’t answer that,” I said. “You know that as well as I do. It takes as\\nlong as it takes. Six months. A year. Probably longer—it could be years.”\\n“You have six weeks.”\\nStephanie drew herself up and crossed her arms. “I am the manager of\\nthis unit, and I simply cannot allow—”\\n“I am clinical director of the Grove. This is my decision, not yours. I take\\nfull responsibility for any injuries incurred upon our long-suffering therapist here,” Diomedes said, winking at me.\\nStephanie didn’t say anything further. She glared at Diomedes, then at\\nme. She turned and walked out.\\n“Oh, dear,” Diomedes said. “You appear to have made an enemy of\\nStephanie. How unfortunate.” He shared a smile with Indira, then gave me a\\nserious look. “Six weeks. Under my supervision. Understand?”\\nI agreed—I had no choice but to agree. “Six weeks.”\\n“Good.”\\nChristian stood up, visibly annoyed. “Alicia won’t talk in six weeks, or\\nsixty years. You’re wasting your time.”\\nHe walked out. I wondered why Christian was so positive I would fail.\\nBut it made me even more determined to succeed. CHAPTER SIX\\nI ARRIVED HOME, FEELING EXHAUSTED. Force of habit made me flick on the\\nlight in the hallway, even though the bulb had gone. We’d been meaning to\\nreplace it but kept forgetting.\\nI knew at once that Kathy wasn’t there. It was too quiet; she was\\nincapable of quiet. She wasn’t noisy but her world was full of sound—\\ntalking on the phone, reciting lines, watching movies, singing, humming,\\nlistening to bands I’d never heard of. But now the flat was silent as a tomb.\\nI called her name. Force of habit, again—or a guilty conscience, perhaps,\\nwanting to make sure I was alone before I transgressed?\\n“Kathy?”\\nNo reply.\\nI fumbled my way through the dark into the living room. I turned on the\\nlight.\\nThe room leaped out at me in the way new furniture always does until\\nyou’re used to it: new chairs, new cushions; new colors, reds and yellows,\\nwhere there once had been black and white. A vase of pink lilies—Kathy’s\\nfavorite flowers—was on the table; their strong musky scent made the air\\nthick and hard to breathe.\\nWhat time was it? Eight-thirty. Where was she? Rehearsal? She was in a\\nnew production of Othello at the RSC, and it wasn’t going particularly well.\\nEndless rehearsals had been taking their toll. She seemed visibly tired, pale,\\nthinner than usual, fighting a cold. “I’m so fucking sick all the time,” she\\nsaid. “I’m exhausted.”\\nIt was true; she’d come back from rehearsal later and later each night,\\nlooking terrible; she’d yawn and stumble straight into bed. So she probably\\nwouldn’t be home for a couple of hours at the earliest. I decided to risk it.\\nI took the jar of weed from its hiding place and started rolling a joint.\\nI’d been smoking marijuana since university. I first encountered it during\\nmy first term, alone and friendless at a fresher party, too paralyzed with fear to initiate a conversation with any of the good-looking and confident young\\npeople around me. I was planning my escape when the girl standing next to\\nme offered me something. I thought it was a cigarette until I smelled the\\nspicy, pungent, curling black smoke. Too shy to refuse, I accepted it and\\nbrought the joint to my lips. It was badly rolled and coming unstuck,\\nunraveling at the end. The tip was wet and stained red from her lipstick. It\\ntasted different from a cigarette; it was richer, rawer, more exotic. I\\nswallowed down the thick smoke and tried not to cough. Initially all I felt\\nwas a little light on my feet. Like sex, clearly more fuss was made over\\nmarijuana than it merited. Then—a minute or so later—something\\nhappened. Something incredible. It was like being drenched in an enormous\\nwave of well-being. I felt safe, relaxed, totally at ease, silly and unself-\\nconscious.\\nThat was it. Before long I was smoking weed every day. It became my\\nbest friend, my inspiration, my solace. An endless ritual of rolling, licking,\\nlighting. I would get stoned just from the rustling of rolling papers and the\\nanticipation of the warm, intoxicating high.\\nAll kinds of theories have been put forward about the origins of\\naddiction. It could be genetic; it could be chemical; it could be\\npsychological. But marijuana was doing something much more than\\nsoothing me: crucially, it altered the way I experienced my emotions; it\\ncradled me and held me safe like a well-loved child.\\nIn other words, it contained me.\\nThe psychoanalyst W. R. Bion came up with the term containment to\\ndescribe a mother’s ability to manage her baby’s pain. Remember,\\nbabyhood is not a time of bliss; it’s one of terror. As babies we are trapped\\nin a strange, alien world, unable to see properly, constantly surprised at our\\nbodies, alarmed by hunger and wind and bowel movements, overwhelmed\\nby our feelings. We are quite literally under attack. We need our mother to\\nsoothe our distress and make sense of our experience. As she does so, we\\nslowly learn how to manage our physical and emotional states on our own.\\nBut our ability to contain ourselves directly depends on our mother’s ability\\nto contain us—if she had never experienced containment by her own\\nmother, how could she teach us what she did not know? Someone who has\\nnever learned to contain himself is plagued by anxious feelings for the rest\\nof his life, feelings that Bion aptly titled nameless dread. Such a person\\nendlessly seeks this unquenchable containment from external sources—he needs a drink or a joint to “take the edge off” this endless anxiety. Hence\\nmy addiction to marijuana.\\nI talked a lot about marijuana in therapy. I wrestled with the idea of\\ngiving it up and wondered why the prospect scared me so much. Ruth said\\nthat enforcement and constraint never produced anything good, and that,\\nrather than force myself to live without weed, a better starting place might\\nbe to acknowledge that I was now dependent on it, and unwilling or unable\\nto abandon it. Whatever marijuana did for me was still working, Ruth\\nargued—until the day it would outlive its usefulness, when I would\\nprobably relinquish it with ease.\\nRuth was right. When I met Kathy and fell in love, marijuana faded into\\nthe background. I was naturally high on love, with no need to artificially\\ninduce a good mood. It helped that Kathy didn’t smoke it. Stoners, in her\\nopinion, were weak willed and lazy and lived in slow motion—you pricked\\nthem and six days later they’d say, “Ouch.” I stopped smoking weed the day\\nKathy moved into my flat. And—as Ruth had predicted—once I was secure\\nand happy, the habit fell away from me quite naturally, like dry caked mud\\nfrom a boot.\\nI might never have smoked it again if we hadn’t gone to a leaving party\\nfor Kathy’s friend Nicole, who was moving to New York. Kathy was\\nmonopolized by all her actor friends, and I found myself alone. A short,\\nstubby man, wearing a pair of neon-pink glasses, nudged me and said,\\n“Want some?” I was about to refuse the joint between his fingers, when\\nsomething stopped me. I’m not sure what. A momentary whim? Or an\\nunconscious attack on Kathy for forcing me to come to this horrible party\\nand then abandoning me? I looked around, and she was nowhere to be seen.\\nFuck it, I thought. I brought the joint to my lips and inhaled.\\nJust like that, I was back where I had started, as if there had been no\\nbreak. My addiction had been patiently waiting for me all this time, like a\\nfaithful dog. I didn’t tell Kathy what I had done, and I put it out of my\\nmind. In fact I was waiting for an opportunity, and six weeks later, it\\npresented itself. Kathy went to New York for a week, to visit Nicole.\\nWithout Kathy’s influence, lonely and bored, I gave in to temptation. I\\ndidn’t have a dealer anymore, so I did what I had done as a student—and\\nmade my way to Camden Town market.\\nAs I left the station, I could smell marijuana in the air, mingled with the\\nscent of incense and food stalls frying onions. I walked over to the bridge by Camden Lock. I stood there awkwardly, pushed and nudged by an\\nendless stream of tourists and teenagers trudging back and forth across the\\nbridge.\\nI scanned the crowd. There was no sign of any of the dealers who used to\\nline the bridge, calling out to you as you passed. I spotted a couple of police\\nofficers, unmissable in their bright yellow jackets, patrolling the crowd.\\nThey walked away from the bridge, toward the station. Then I heard a low\\nvoice by my side:\\n“Want some green, mate?”\\nI looked down and there was a small man. I thought he was a child at\\nfirst, he was so slight and slender. But his face was a road map of rugged\\nterrain, lined and crossed, like a boy prematurely aged. He was missing his\\ntwo front teeth, giving his words a slight whistle. “Green?” he repeated.\\nI nodded.\\nHe jerked his head at me to follow him. He slipped through the crowd\\nand went around the corner and along a backstreet. He entered an old pub\\nand I followed. It was deserted inside, dingy and tattered, and stank of\\nvomit and old cigarette smoke.\\n“Gissa beer,” he said, hovering at the bar. He was scarcely tall enough to\\nsee over it. I begrudgingly bought him half a pint. He took it to a table in\\nthe corner. I sat opposite him. He looked around furtively, then reached\\nunder the table and slipped me a small package wrapped in cellophane. I\\ngave him some cash.\\nI went home and I opened the package, half expecting to have been\\nripped off, but a familiar pungent smell drifted to my nose. I saw the little\\ngreen buds streaked with gold. My heart raced as though I had encountered\\na long-lost friend; which I suppose I had.\\nFrom then on, I would get high occasionally, whenever I found myself\\nalone in the flat for a few hours, when I was sure Kathy would not be\\ncoming back anytime soon.\\nThat night, when I came home, tired and frustrated, and found Kathy out\\nat rehearsal, I quickly rolled a joint. I smoked it out of the bathroom\\nwindow. But I smoked too much, too fast—it hit me hard, like a punch\\nbetween the eyes. I was so stoned, even walking felt difficult, like wading\\nthrough treacle. I went through my usual sanitizing ritual—air freshener,\\nbrushing my teeth, taking a shower—and I carefully maneuvered myself to\\nthe living room. I sank onto the sofa. I looked for the TV remote but couldn’t see it. Then I located it, peeking\\nout from behind Kathy’s open laptop on the coffee table. I reached for it,\\nbut was so stoned I knocked over the laptop. I propped the laptop up again\\n—and the screen came to life. It was logged into her email account. For\\nsome reason, I kept staring at it. I was transfixed—her in-box stared at me\\nlike a gaping hole. I couldn’t look away. All kinds of things jumped out\\nbefore I knew what I was reading: words such as “sexy” and “fuck” in the\\nemail headings—and repeated emails from BADBOY22.\\nIf only I’d stopped there. If only I’d got up and walked away—but I\\ndidn’t.\\nI clicked on the most recent email and opened it:\\nSubject: Re: little miss fuck\\nFrom: Katerama_1\\nTo: BADBOY22\\nI’m on the bus. So horny for you. I can smell you on me. I feel\\nlike a slut! Kxx\\nSent from my iPhone\\n_______________________________________\\nSubject: Re: re: re: little miss fuck\\nFrom: BADBOY22\\nTo: Katerama_1\\nU r a slut! Lol. C u later?

I sat with it on my lap, staring at it. I\\ndon’t know how long I sat like that. Ten minutes? Twenty minutes? Half an\\nhour? Maybe longer. Time seemed to slow to a crawl.\\nI tried to process what I had just seen, but I was still so stoned, I wasn’t\\nsure what I had seen. Was it real? Or some kind of misunderstanding—\\nsome joke I wasn’t getting because I was so high?\\nI forced myself to read another email.\\nAnd another.\\nI ended up going through all of Kathy’s emails to BADBOY22. Some\\nwere sexual, obscene even. Others were longer, more confessional,\\nemotional, and she sounded drunk—perhaps they were written late at night,\\nafter I had gone to bed. I pictured myself in the bedroom, asleep, while\\nKathy was out here, writing intimate messages to this stranger. This\\nstranger she was fucking.\\nTime caught up with itself with a jolt. Suddenly I was no longer stoned. I\\nwas horribly, painfully sober.\\nThere was a wrenching pain in my stomach. I threw aside the laptop. I\\nran into the bathroom.\\nI fell to my knees in front of the toilet and threw up. CHAPTER SEVEN\\n“THIS FEELS RATHER DIFFERENT from last time,” I said.\\nNo response.\\nAlicia sat opposite me in the chair, head turned slightly toward the\\nwindow. She sat perfectly still, her spine rigid and straight. She looked like\\na cellist. Or a soldier.\\n“I’m thinking of how the last session ended. When you physically\\nattacked me and had to be restrained.”\\nNo response. I hesitated.\\n“I wonder if you did it as some kind of test? To see what I’m made of? I\\nthink it’s important that you know I’m not easily intimidated. I can take\\nwhatever you throw at me.”\\nAlicia looked out the window at the gray sky beyond the bars. I waited a\\nmoment.\\n“There’s something I need to tell you, Alicia. That I’m on your side.\\nHopefully one day you’ll believe that. Of course, it takes time to build trust.\\nMy old therapist used to say intimacy requires the repeated experience of\\nbeing responded to—and that doesn’t happen overnight.”\\nAlicia stared at me, unblinking, with an inscrutable gaze. The minutes\\npassed. It felt more like an endurance test than a therapy session.\\nI wasn’t making progress in any direction, it seemed. Perhaps it was all\\nhopeless. Christian had been right to point out that rats desert sinking ships.\\nWhat the hell was I doing clambering upon this wreck, lashing myself to\\nthe mast, preparing to drown?\\nThe answer was sitting in front of me. As Diomedes put it, Alicia was a\\nsilent siren, luring me to my doom.\\nI felt a sudden desperation. I wanted to scream at her, Say something.\\nAnything. Just talk.\\nBut I didn’t say that. Instead, I broke with therapeutic tradition. I stopped\\ntreading softly and got directly to the point: “I’d like to talk about your silence. About what it means … what it feels\\nlike. And specifically why you stopped talking.”\\nAlicia didn’t look at me. Was she even listening?\\n“As I sit here with you, a picture keeps coming into my mind—an image\\nof someone biting their fist, holding back a yell, swallowing a scream. I\\nremember when I first started therapy, I found it very hard to cry. I feared\\nI’d be carried away by the flood, overwhelmed. Perhaps that’s what it feels\\nlike for you. That’s why it’s important to take your time to feel safe and\\ntrust that you won’t be alone in this flood—that I’m treading water here\\nwith you.”\\nSilence.\\n“I think of myself as a relational therapist. Do you know what that\\nmeans?”\\nSilence.\\n“It means I think Freud was wrong about a couple of things. I don’t\\nbelieve a therapist can ever really be a blank slate, as he intended. We leak\\nall kinds of information about ourselves unintentionally—by the color of\\nmy socks, or how I sit or the way I talk. Just by sitting here with you, I\\nreveal a great deal about myself. Despite my best efforts at invisibility, I’m\\nshowing you who I am.”\\nAlicia looked up. She stared at me, her chin slightly tilted—was there a\\nchallenge in that look? At last I had her attention. I shifted in my seat.\\n“The point is, what can we do about this? We can ignore it and deny it\\nand pretend this therapy is all about you. Or we can acknowledge that this is\\na two-way street and work with that. And then we can really start to get\\nsomewhere.”\\nI held up my hand. I nodded at my wedding ring.\\n“This ring tells you something, doesn’t it?”\\nAlicia’s eyes ever so slowly moved in the direction of the ring.\\n“It tells you I’m a married man. It tells you I have a wife. We’ve been\\nmarried for nearly nine years.”\\nNo response, yet she kept staring at the ring.\\n“You were married for about seven years, weren’t you?”\\nNo reply.\\n“I love my wife very much. Did you love your husband?”\\nAlicia’s eyes moved. They darted up to my face. We stared at each other. “Love includes all kinds of feelings, doesn’t it? Good and bad. I love my\\nwife—her name is Kathy—but sometimes I get angry with her.\\nSometimes … I hate her.”\\nAlicia kept staring at me; I felt like a rabbit in the headlights, frozen,\\nunable to look away or move. The attack alarm was on the table, within\\nreach. I made a concerted effort not to look at it.\\nI knew I shouldn’t keep talking—that I should shut up—but I couldn’t\\nstop myself. I went on compulsively:\\n“And when I say I hate her, I don’t mean all of me hates her. Just a part\\nof me hates. It’s about holding on to both parts at the same time. Part of you\\nloved Gabriel. Part of you hated him.”\\nAlicia shook her head—no. A brief movement, but definite. Finally—a\\nresponse. I felt a sudden thrill. I should have stopped there, but I didn’t.\\n“Part of you hated him,” I said again more firmly.\\nAnother shake of the head. Her eyes burned through me. She’s getting\\nangry, I thought.\\n“It’s true, Alicia. Or you wouldn’t have killed him.”\\nAlicia suddenly jumped up. I thought she was about to leap on me. My\\nbody tensed in anticipation. But instead she turned and marched to the door.\\nShe hammered on it with her fists.\\nThere was the sound of a key turning—and Yuri threw open the door. He\\nlooked relieved not to find Alicia strangling me on the floor. She pushed\\npast him and ran into the corridor.\\n“Steady on, slow down, honey.” He glanced back at me. “Everything\\nokay? What happened?”\\nI didn’t reply. Yuri gave me a funny look and left. I was alone.\\nIdiot, I thought to myself. You idiot. What was I doing? I’d pushed her\\ntoo far, too hard, too soon. It was horribly unprofessional, not to mention\\ntotally fucking inept. It revealed far more about my state of mind than hers.\\nBut that’s what Alicia did for you. Her silence was like a mirror—\\nreflecting yourself back at you.\\nAnd it was often an ugly sight. CHAPTER EIGHT\\nYOU DON’T NEED TO BE A PSYCHOTHERAPIST to suspect that Kathy had left her\\nlaptop open because—unconsciously, at least—she wanted me to find out\\nabout her infidelity.\\nWell, now I had found out. Now I knew.\\nI hadn’t spoken to her since the other night, feigning sleep when she got\\nback, and leaving the flat in the morning before she woke up. I was\\navoiding her—avoiding myself. I was in shock. I knew I had to take a look\\nat myself—or risk losing myself. Get a grip, I muttered under my breath as\\nI rolled a joint. I smoked it out of the window, and then, suitably stoned, I\\npoured a glass of wine in the kitchen.\\nThe glass slipped out of my grasp as I picked it up. I tried to catch it as it\\nfell, but only succeeded in thrusting my hand into a shard of glass as it\\nsmashed on the table, slicing a chunk of flesh from my finger.\\nSuddenly blood was everywhere: blood trickling down my arm, blood on\\nbroken glass, blood mingling with white wine on the table. I struggled to\\ntear off some kitchen paper and bound my finger tight to stem the flow. I\\nheld my hand above my head, watching blood stream down my arm in tiny\\ndiverging rivulets, mimicking the pattern of veins beneath my skin.\\nI thought of Kathy.\\nIt was Kathy I would reach for in a moment of crisis—when I needed\\nsympathy or reassurance or someone to kiss it better. I wanted her to look\\nafter me. I thought about calling her, but even as I had this thought, I\\nimagined a door closing fast, slamming shut, locking her out of reach.\\nKathy was gone—I had lost her. I wanted to cry, but couldn’t—I was\\nblocked up inside, packed with mud and shit.\\n“Fuck,” I kept repeating to myself, “fuck.”\\nI became conscious of the clock ticking. It seemed louder now somehow.\\nI tried to focus on it and anchor my spinning thoughts: tick, tick, tick—but\\nthe chorus of voices in my head grew louder and wouldn’t be silenced. She was bound to be unfaithful, I thought, this had to happen, it was inevitable\\n—I was never good enough for her, I was useless, ugly, worthless, nothing\\n—she was bound to tire of me eventually—I didn’t deserve her, I didn’t\\ndeserve anything—it went on and on, one horrible thought after another\\npunching me.\\nHow little I knew her. Those emails demonstrated I’d been living with a\\nstranger. Now I saw the truth. Kathy hadn’t saved me—she wasn’t capable\\nof saving anyone. She was no heroine to be admired—just a frightened,\\nfucked-up girl, a cheating liar. This whole mythology of us that I had built\\nup, our hopes and dreams, likes and dislikes, our plans for the future; a life\\nthat had seemed so secure, so sturdy, now collapsed in seconds—like a\\nhouse of cards in a gust of wind.\\nMy mind went to that cold room at college, all those years ago—tearing\\nopen packets of paracetamol with clumsy, numb fingers. The same\\nnumbness overtook me now, that same desire to curl up and die. I thought\\nof my mother. Could I call her? Turn to her in my moment of desperation\\nand need? I imagined her answering the phone, her voice shaky; just how\\nshaky depended on my father’s mood, and if she’d been drinking. She\\nmight listen sympathetically to me, but her mind would be elsewhere, one\\neye on my dad and his temper. How could she help me? How can one\\ndrowning rat save another?\\nI had to get out. I couldn’t breathe in here, in this flat with these stinking\\nlilies. I needed some air. I needed to breathe.\\nI left the flat. I dug my hands in my pockets and kept my head low. I\\npounded the streets, walking fast, going nowhere. In my mind I kept going\\nback over our relationship, scene by scene, remembering it, examining it,\\nturning it over, looking for clues. I remembered unresolved fights,\\nunexplained absences, and frequent lateness. But I also remembered small\\nacts of kindness—affectionate notes she’d leave for me in unexpected\\nplaces, moments of sweetness and apparently genuine love. How was this\\npossible? Had she been acting the whole time? Had she ever loved me?\\nI remembered the flicker of doubt I’d had upon meeting her friends. They\\nwere all actors; loud, narcissistic, preening, endlessly talking about\\nthemselves and people I didn’t know. Suddenly I was transported back to\\nschool, hovering alone on the fringes of the playground, watching the other\\nkids play. I convinced myself Kathy wasn’t like them at all—but clearly she\\nwas. If had I encountered them that first night at the bar when I met her, would they have put me off her? I doubt it. Nothing could have prevented\\nour union: from the moment I saw Kathy, my fate was written.\\nWhat should I do?\\nConfront her, of course. Tell her everything I had seen. She’d react by\\ndenying it—then, seeing it was hopeless, she would admit the truth and\\nprostrate herself, stricken with remorse. She’d beg my forgiveness,\\nwouldn’t she?\\nWhat if she didn’t? What if she scorned me? What if she laughed, turned\\non her heel, and left? What then?\\nBetween the two of us, I had the most to lose, that was obvious. Kathy\\nwould survive—she was fond of saying she was tough as nails. She’d pick\\nherself up, dust herself off, and forget all about me. But I wouldn’t forget\\nabout her. How could I? Without Kathy, I’d return to that empty, solitary\\nexistence I had endured before. I’d never meet anyone like her again, never\\nhave that same connection or experience that depth of feeling for another\\nhuman being. She was the love of my life—she was my life—and I wasn’t\\nready to give her up. Not yet. Even though she had betrayed me, I still\\nloved her.\\nPerhaps I was crazy, after all.\\nA solitary bird shrieked above my head, startling me. I stopped and\\nlooked around. I’d gone much farther than I thought. Shocked, I saw where\\nmy feet had carried me—I had walked to within a couple of streets of\\nRuth’s front door.\\nWithout intending to, I had unconsciously made my way to my old\\ntherapist in a time of trouble, as I had done so many times in the past. It was\\na testament to how upset I was that I considered going up to her door and\\nringing the bell and asking for help.\\nAnd why not? I thought suddenly; yes, it was unprofessional and highly\\nimproper conduct, but I was desperate, and I needed help. Before I knew it,\\nI was standing in front of Ruth’s green door, watching my hand reach up to\\nthe buzzer and press it.\\nIt took her a few moments to answer it. A light went on the hallway, then\\nshe opened the door, keeping the chain on.\\nRuth peered out through the crack. She looked older. She must be in her\\neighties now; smaller, frailer than I remembered, and slightly stooped. She\\nwas wearing a gray cardigan over a pale pink nightgown.\\n“Hello?” she said nervously. “Who’s there? “Hello, Ruth.” I stepped into the light.\\nShe recognized me and looked surprised. “Theo? What on earth—” Her\\neyes went from my face to the clumsy, improvised bandage around my\\nfinger, with blood seeping through it. “Are you all right?”\\n“Not really. May I come in? I—I need to talk to you.”\\nRuth didn’t hesitate, only looked concerned. She nodded. “Of course.\\nCome in.” She undid the chain and opened the door.\\nI stepped inside. CHAPTER NINE\\nRUTH SHOWED ME INTO THE LIVING ROOM. “Would you like a cup of tea?”\\nThe room was as it had always been, as I’d always remembered it—the\\nrug, the heavy drapes, the silver clock ticking on the mantel, the armchair,\\nthe faded blue couch. I felt instantly reassured.\\n“To be honest, I could do with something stronger.”\\nRuth shot me a brief, piercing glance, but didn’t comment. Nor did she\\nrefuse, as I half expected.\\nShe poured me a glass of sherry and handed it to me. I sat on the couch.\\nForce of habit made me sit where I had always done for therapy, on the far\\nleft side, resting my arm on the armrest. The fabric underneath my\\nfingertips had been worn thin by the anxious rubbing of many patients,\\nmyself included.\\nI took a sip of sherry. It was warm, sweet, and little sickly, but I drank it\\ndown, conscious of Ruth watching me the whole time. Her gaze was\\nobvious but not heavy or uncomfortable; in twenty years Ruth had never\\nmanaged to make me feel uncomfortable. I didn’t speak again until I had\\nfinished the sherry and the glass was empty.\\n“It feels odd to be sitting here with a glass in my hand. I know you’re not\\nin the habit of offering drinks to your patients.”\\n“You’re not my patient anymore. Just a friend—and by the look of you,”\\nshe added gently, “you need a friend right now.”\\n“Do I look that bad?”\\n“You do, I’m afraid. And it must be serious, or you wouldn’t come over\\nuninvited like this. Certainly not at ten o’clock at night.”\\n“You’re right. I felt—I felt I had no choice.”\\n“What is it, Theo? What’s the matter?”\\n“I don’t how to tell you. I don’t know where to start.”\\n“How about the beginning?” I nodded. I took a breath and began. I told her about everything that had\\nhappened; I told her about starting marijuana again, and how I had been\\nsmoking it secretly—and how it had led to my discovering Kathy’s emails\\nand her affair. I spoke quickly, breathlessly, wanting to get it off my chest. I\\nfelt as if I were at confession.\\nRuth listened without interruption until I had finished. It was hard to read\\nher expression. Finally she said, “I am very sorry this happened, Theo. I\\nknow how much Kathy means to you. How much you love her.”\\n“Yes. I love—” I stopped, unable to say her name. There was a tremor in\\nmy voice. Ruth picked up on it and edged the box of tissues toward me. I\\nused to get angry when she would do that in our sessions; I’d accuse her of\\ntrying to make me cry. She would generally succeed. But not tonight.\\nTonight my tears were frozen. A reservoir of ice.\\nI had been seeing Ruth for a long time before I met Kathy, and I\\ncontinued therapy for the first three years of our relationship. I remember\\nthe advice Ruth gave me when Kathy and I first got together: “Choosing a\\nlover is a lot like choosing a therapist. We need to ask ourselves, is this\\nsomeone who will be honest with me, listen to criticism, admit making\\nmistakes, and not promise the impossible?”\\nI told all this to Kathy at the time, and she suggested we make a pact. We\\nswore never to lie to each other. Never pretend. Always be truthful.\\n“What happened?” I said. “What went wrong?”\\nRuth hesitated before she spoke. What she said surprised me.\\n“I suspect you know the answer to that. If you would just admit it to\\nyourself.”\\n“I don’t know.” I shook my head. “I don’t.”\\nI fell into indignant silence—yet I had a sudden image of Kathy writing\\nall those emails, and how passionate they were, how charged, as if she was\\ngetting high from writing them, from the clandestine nature of her\\nrelationship with this man. She enjoyed lying and sneaking around: it was\\nlike acting, but offstage.\\n“I think she’s bored,” I said eventually.\\n“What makes you say that?”\\n“Because she needs excitement. Drama. She always has. She’s been\\ncomplaining—for a while, I suppose—that we don’t have any fun anymore,\\nthat I’m always stressed, that I work too hard. We fought about it recently.\\nShe kept using the word fireworks.” “Fireworks?”\\n“As in there aren’t any. Between us.”\\n“Ah. I see.” Ruth nodded. “We’ve talked about this before. Haven’t we?”\\n“About fireworks?”\\n“About love. About how we often mistake love for fireworks—for drama\\nand dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still. It’s boring, if seen\\nfrom the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm—and constant. I\\nimagine you do give Kathy love—in the true sense of the word. Whether or\\nnot she is capable of giving it back to you is another question.”\\nI stared at the box of tissues on the table in front of me. I didn’t like\\nwhere Ruth was going. I tried to deflect her.\\n“There are faults on both sides. I lied to her too. About the weed.”\\nRuth smiled sadly. “I don’t know if persistent sexual and emotional\\nbetrayal with another human being is on the same level as getting stoned\\nevery now and then. I think it points to a very different kind of individual—\\nsomeone who is able to lie repeatedly and lie well, who can betray their\\npartner without feeling any remorse—”\\n“You don’t know that.” I sounded as pathetic as I felt. “She might feel\\nterrible.”\\nBut even as I said that, I didn’t believe it.\\nNeither did Ruth. “I don’t think so. I think her behavior suggests she is\\nquite damaged—lacking in empathy and integrity and just plain kindness—\\nall the qualities you brim with.”\\nI shook my head. “That’s not true.”\\n“It is true, Theo.” Ruth hesitated. “Don’t you think perhaps you’ve been\\nhere before?”\\n“With Kathy?”\\nRuth shook her head. “I don’t mean that. I mean with your parents. When\\nyou were younger. If there’s a childhood dynamic here you might be\\nreplaying.”\\n“No.” I suddenly felt irritated. “What’s happening with Kathy has got\\nnothing to do with my childhood.”\\n“Oh, really?” Ruth sounded disbelieving. “Trying to please someone\\nunpredictable, someone emotionally unavailable, uncaring, unkind—trying\\nto keep them happy, win their love—is this not an old story, Theo? A\\nfamiliar story?”\\nI clenched my fist and didn’t speak. Ruth went on hesitantly, “I know how sad you feel. But I want you to\\nconsider the possibility that you felt this sadness long before you met\\nKathy. It’s a sadness you’ve been carrying around for many years. You\\nknow, Theo, one of the hardest things to admit is that we weren’t loved\\nwhen we needed it most. It’s a terrible feeling, the pain of not being loved.”\\nShe was right. I had been groping for the right words to express that\\nmurky feeling of betrayal inside, the horrible hollow ache, and to hear Ruth\\nsay it—“the pain of not being loved”—I saw how it pervaded my entire\\nconsciousness and was at once the story of my past, present, and future.\\nThis wasn’t just about Kathy: it was about my father, and my childhood\\nfeelings of abandonment; my grief for everything I never had and, in my\\nheart, still believed I never would have. Ruth was saying that was why I\\nchose Kathy. What better way for me to prove that my father was correct—\\nthat I’m worthless and unlovable—than by pursuing someone who will\\nnever love me?\\nI buried my head in my hands. “So all this was inevitable? That’s what\\nyou’re saying—I set myself up for this? It’s fucking hopeless?”\\n“It’s not hopeless. You’re not a boy at the mercy of your father anymore.\\nYou’re a grown man now—and you have a choice. Use this as another\\nconfirmation of how unworthy you are—or break with the past. Free\\nyourself from endlessly repeating it.”\\n“How do I do that? You think I should leave her?”\\n“I think it’s a very difficult situation.”\\n“But you think I should leave, don’t you?”\\n“You’ve come too far and worked too hard to return to a life of\\ndishonesty and denial and emotional abuse. You deserve someone who\\ntreats you better, much better—”\\n“Just say it, Ruth. Say it. You think I should leave.”\\nRuth looked me in the eyes. She held my gaze. “I think you must leave.\\nAnd I’m not saying this as your old therapist—but as your old friend. I\\ndon’t think you could go back, even if you wanted to. It might last a little\\nwhile perhaps, but in a few months something else will happen and you’ll\\nend up back here on this couch. Be honest with yourself, Theo—about\\nKathy and this situation—and everything built on lies and untruths will fall\\naway from you. Remember, love that doesn’t include honesty doesn’t\\ndeserve to be called love.”\\nI sighed, deflated, depressed, and tired. “Thank you, Ruth—for your honesty. It means a lot.”\\nRuth gave me a hug at the door as I left. She’d never done that before.\\nShe was fragile in my arms, her bones so delicate; I breathed in her faint\\nflowery scent and the wool of her cardigan and again I felt like crying. But I\\ndidn’t, or couldn’t, cry.\\nInstead I walked away and didn’t look back.\\nI caught a bus back home. I sat by the window, staring out, thinking of\\nKathy, of her white skin, and those beautiful green eyes. I was filled with\\nsuch a longing—for the sweet taste of her lips, her softness. But Ruth was\\nright. Love that doesn’t include honesty doesn’t deserve to be called love.\\nI had to go home and confront Kathy.\\nI had to leave her. CHAPTER TEN\\nKATHY WAS THERE WHEN I GOT HOME. She was sitting on the couch, texting.\\n“Where were you?” she asked without looking up.\\n“Just a walk. How was rehearsal?”\\n“All right. Tiring.”\\nI watched her texting, wondering who she was writing to. I knew this was\\nmy moment to speak. I know you’re having an affair—I want a divorce. I\\nopened my mouth to say it. But I found I was mute. Before I could recover\\nmy voice, Kathy beat me to it. She stopped texting and put down her phone.\\n“Theo, we need to talk.”\\n“What about?”\\n“Don’t you have something to tell me?” Her voice had a stern note.\\nI avoided looking at her, in case she could read my thoughts. I felt\\nashamed and furtive—as if I were the one with the guilty secret.\\nAnd I was, as far as she was concerned. Kathy reached behind the sofa\\nand picked something up. At once my heart sank. She was holding the small\\njar where I kept the grass. I’d forgotten to hide it back in the spare room\\nafter I’d cut my finger.\\n“What’s this?” She held it up.\\n“It’s weed.”\\n“I’m aware of that. What’s it doing here?”\\n“I bought some. I fancied it.”\\n“Fancied what? Getting high? Are you—serious?”\\nI shrugged, evading her eye, like a naughty child.\\n“What the fuck? I mean, Jesus—” Kathy shook her head, outraged.\\n“Sometimes I think I don’t know you at all.”\\nI wanted to hit her. I wanted to leap on her and beat her with my fists. I\\nwanted to smash up the room, break the furniture against the walls. I\\nwanted to weep and howl and bury myself in her arms.\\nI did none of this. “Let’s go to bed,” I said, and walked out.\\nWe went to bed in silence. I lay in the dark next to her. I lay awake for\\nhours, feeling the heat from her body, staring at her while she slept.\\nWhy didn’t you come to me? I wanted to say. Why didn’t you talk to me?\\nI was your best friend. If you had said just one word, we could have worked\\nthrough it. Why didn’t you talk to me? I’m here. I’m right here.\\nI wanted to reach out and pull her close. I wanted to hold her. But I\\ncouldn’t. Kathy had gone—the person I loved so much had disappeared\\nforever, leaving this stranger in her place.\\nA sob rose at the back of my throat. Finally, the tears came, streaming\\ndown my cheeks.\\nSilently, in the darkness, I wept.\\n*   *   *\\nThe next morning, we got up and performed the usual routine—she went\\ninto the bathroom while I made coffee. I handed her a cup when she came\\ninto the kitchen.\\n“You were making strange sounds in the night,” she said. “You were\\ntalking in your sleep.”\\n“What did I say?”\\n“I don’t know. Nothing. Didn’t make sense. Probably because you were\\nso stoned.” She gave me a withering look and glanced at her watch. “I have\\nto go. I’ll be late.”\\nKathy finished her coffee and placed the cup in the sink. She gave me a\\nquick kiss on the cheek. The touch of her lips almost made me flinch.\\nAfter she left, I showered. I turned up the temperature until it was almost\\nscalding. The hot water lashed against my face as I wept, burning away\\nmessy, babyish tears. As I dried myself afterward, I caught a glimpse of my\\nreflection in the mirror. I was shocked—I was ashen, shrunken, had aged\\nthirty years overnight. I was old, exhausted, my youth evaporated.\\nI made a decision, there and then.\\nLeaving Kathy would be like tearing off a limb. I simply wasn’t prepared\\nto mutilate myself like that. No matter what Ruth said. Ruth wasn’t\\ninfallible. Kathy was not my father; I wasn’t condemned to repeat the past. I\\ncould change the future. Kathy and I were happy before; we could be again.\\nOne day she might confess it all to me, tell me about it, and I would forgive\\nher. We would work through this. I would not let Kathy go. Instead I would say nothing. I would pretend I\\nhad never read those emails. Somehow, I’d forget. I’d bury it. I had no\\nchoice but to go on. I refused to give in to this; I refused to break down and\\nfall apart.\\nAfter all, I wasn’t just responsible for myself. What about the patients in\\nmy care? Certain people depended on me.\\nI couldn’t let them down. CHAPTER ELEVEN\\n“I’M LOOKING FOR ELIF, Any idea where I can find her?”\\nYuri gave me a curious look. “Any reason you want her?”\\n“Just to say a quick hello. I want to meet all the patients—let them know\\nwho I am, that I’m here.”\\nYuri looked doubtful. “Right. Well, don’t take it personally if she’s not\\nvery receptive.” He glanced at the clock on the wall. “It’s after half past, so\\nshe’s just out of art therapy. Your best bet is the recreation room.”\\n“Thanks.”\\nThe recreation area was a large circular room furnished with battered\\ncouches, low tables, a bookcase full of tattered books no one wanted to\\nread. It smelled of stale tea and old cigarette smoke that had stained the\\nfurnishings. A couple of patients were playing backgammon in a corner.\\nElif was alone at the pool table. I approached with a smile.\\n“Hello, Elif.”\\nShe looked up with scared, mistrustful eyes. “What?”\\n“Don’t worry, there’s nothing wrong. I just want a quick word.”\\n“You ain’t my doctor. I already got one.”\\n“I’m not a doctor. I’m a psychotherapist.”\\nElif grunted contemptuously. “I got one of them too.”\\nI smiled, secretly relieved she was Indira’s patient and not mine. Up close\\nElif was even more intimidating. It wasn’t just her massive size, but also the\\nrage etched deep into her face—a permanent scowl and angry black eyes,\\neyes that were quite clearly disturbed. She stank of sweat and the hand-\\nrolled cigarettes she was always smoking, that had left her fingertips stained\\nblack and her nails and teeth a dark yellow.\\n“I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions, if that’s okay—about\\nAlicia.”\\nElif scowled and banged the cue on the table. She starting setting up the\\nballs for another game. Then she stopped. She just stood there, looking distracted, in silence.\\n“Elif?”\\nShe didn’t respond. I could tell from her expression what was wrong.\\n“Are you hearing voices, Elif?”\\nA suspicious glance. A shrug.\\n“What are they saying?”\\n“You ain’t safe. Telling me to watch out.”\\n“I see. Quite right. You don’t know me—so it’s sensible not to trust me.\\nNot yet. Perhaps, over time, that will change.”\\nElif gave me a look that suggested she doubted it.\\nI nodded at the pool table. “Fancy a game?”\\n“Nope.”\\n“Why not?”\\nShe shrugged. “Other cue’s broke. They ain’t replaced it yet.”\\n“But I can share your cue, can’t I?”\\nThe cue was resting on the table. I went to touch it—and she yanked it\\nout of reach. “It’s my fuckin’ cue! Get your own!”\\nI stepped back, unnerved by the ferocity of her reaction. She played a\\nshot with considerable force. I watched her play for a moment. Then I tried\\nagain.\\n“I was wondering if you could tell me about something that happened\\nwhen Alicia was first admitted to the Grove. Do you remember?”\\nElif shook her head.\\n“I read in her file that you had an altercation in the canteen. You were on\\nthe receiving end of an attack?”\\n“Oh, yeah, yeah, she tried to kill me, innit? Tried to cut my fucking\\nthroat.”\\n“According to the handover notes, a nurse saw you whisper something to\\nAlicia before the attack. I was wondering what it was?”\\n“No.” Elif shook her head furiously. “I didn’t say nothing.”\\n“I’m not trying to suggest you provoked her. I’m just curious. What was\\nit?”\\n“I asked her something, so fucking what?”\\n“What did you ask?”\\n“I asked if he deserved it.”\\n“Who?” “Him. Her bloke.” Elif smiled, although it wasn’t really a smile, more a\\nmisshapen grimace.\\n“You mean her husband?” I hesitated, unsure if I understood. “You asked\\nAlicia if her husband deserved to be killed?”\\nElif nodded and played a shot. “And I asked what he looked like. When\\nshe shot him and his skull was broke, and his brains all spilled out.” Elif\\nlaughed.\\nI felt a sudden wave of disgust—similar to the feelings I imagined Elif\\nhad provoked in Alicia. Elif made you feel repulsion and hatred—that was\\nher pathology, that was how her mother had made her feel as a small child.\\nHateful and repulsive. So Elif unconsciously provoked you to hate her—\\nand mostly she succeeded.\\n“And how are things now? Are you and Alicia on good terms?”\\n“Oh, yeah, mate. We’re real tight. Best mates.” Elif laughed again.\\nBefore I could respond, I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket. I checked\\nit. I didn’t recognize the number.\\n“I should answer this. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful.”\\nElif muttered something unintelligible and went back to her game.\\n*   *   *\\nI walked into the corridor and answered the phone. “Hello?”\\n“Is that Theo Faber?”\\n“Speaking. Who’s this?”\\n“Max Berenson here, returning your call.”\\n“Oh, yes. Hi. Thanks for calling me back. I was wondering if we could\\nhave a conversation about Alicia?”\\n“Why? What’s happened? Is something wrong?”\\n“No. I mean, not exactly—I’m treating her, and I wanted to ask you a\\ncouple of questions about her. Whenever’s convenient.”\\n“I don’t suppose we could do it on the phone? I’m rather busy.”\\n“I’d rather talk in person, if possible.”\\nMax Berenson sighed and mumbled as he spoke to someone off the\\nphone. And then: “Tomorrow evening, seven o’clock, my office.”\\nI was about to ask for the address—but he hung up. CHAPTER TWELVE\\nMAX BERENSON’S RECEPTIONIST had a bad cold. She reached for a tissue, blew\\nher nose, and gestured at me to wait.\\n“He’s on the phone. He’ll be out in a minute.”\\nI nodded and took a seat in the waiting area. A few uncomfortable\\nupright chairs, a coffee table with a stack of out-of-date magazines. All\\nwaiting rooms looked alike, I thought; I could just as easily have been\\nwaiting to see a doctor or funeral director as a lawyer.\\nThe door across the hallway opened. Max Berenson appeared and\\nbeckoned me over. He disappeared back into his office. I got up and\\nfollowed him inside.\\nI expected the worst, given his gruff manner on the phone. But to my\\nsurprise, he began with an apology.\\n“I’m sorry if I was abrupt when we spoke. It’s been a long week and I’m\\na bit under the weather. Won’t you sit down?”\\nI sat on the chair on the other side of the desk. “Thanks. And thank you\\nfor agreeing to see me.”\\n“Well, I wasn’t sure I should at first. I thought you were a journalist,\\ntrying to get me to talk about Alicia. But then I called the Grove and\\nchecked you worked there.”\\n“I see. Does that happen a lot? Journalists, I mean?”\\n“Not recently. It used to. I learned to be on my guard—” He was about to\\nsay something else, but a sneeze overtook him. He reached for a box of\\ntissues. “Sorry—I have the family cold.”\\nHe blew his nose. I glanced at him more closely. Unlike his younger\\nbrother, Max Berenson was not attractive. Max was imposing, balding, and\\nhis face was speckled with deep acne scars. He was wearing an old-\\nfashioned spicy men’s cologne, the kind my father used to wear. His office\\nwas similarly traditional and had the reassuring smell of leather furniture,\\nwood, books. It couldn’t be more different from the world inhabited by Gabriel—a world of color and beauty for beauty’s sake. He and Max were\\nobviously nothing alike.\\nA framed photograph of Gabriel was on the desk. A candid shot—\\npossibly taken by Max? Gabriel was sitting on a fence in a country field, his\\nhair blowing in the breeze, a camera slung around his neck. He looked more\\nlike an actor than a photographer. Or an actor playing a photographer.\\nMax caught me looking at the picture and nodded as if reading my mind.\\n“My brother got the hair and the looks. I got the brains.” Max laughed. “I’m\\njoking. Actually, I was adopted. We weren’t blood related.”\\n“I didn’t know that. Were you both adopted?”\\n“No, just me. Our parents thought they couldn’t have children. But after\\nthey adopted me, they conceived a child of their own soon after. It’s quite\\ncommon apparently. Something to do with relieving stress.”\\n“Were you and Gabriel close?”\\n“Closer than most. Though he took center stage, of course. I was rather\\novershadowed by him.”\\n“Why was that?”\\n“Well, it was difficult not to be. Gabriel was special, even as a child.”\\nMax had a habit of playing with his wedding ring. He kept turning it around\\nhis finger as he talked. “Gabriel used to carry his camera everywhere, you\\nknow, taking pictures. My father thought he was mad. Turns out he was a\\nbit of a genius, my brother. Do you know his work?”\\nI smiled diplomatically. I had no desire to get into a discussion of\\nGabriel’s merits as a photographer.\\nInstead I steered the conversation back to Alicia. “You must have known\\nher quite well?”\\n“Alicia? Must I?” Something in Max changed at the mention of her\\nname. His warmth evaporated. His tone was cold. “I don’t know if I can\\nhelp you. I didn’t represent Alicia in court. I can put you in touch with my\\ncolleague Patrick Doherty if you want details about the trial.”\\n“That’s not the kind of information I’m after.”\\n“No?” Max gave me a curious look. “As a psychotherapist, it can’t be\\ncommon practice to meet your patient’s lawyer?”\\n“Not if my patient can speak for herself, no.”\\nMax seemed to mull this over. “I see. Well, as I said, I don’t know how I\\ncan help, so—”\\n“I just have a couple of questions.” “Very well. Fire away.”\\n“I remember reading in the press at the time that you saw Gabriel and\\nAlicia the night before the murder?”\\n“Yes, we had dinner together.”\\n“How did they seem?”\\nMax’s eyes glazed over. Presumably he’d been asked this question\\nhundreds of times, and his response was automatic, without thinking.\\n“Normal. Totally normal.”\\n“And Alicia?”\\n“Normal.” He shrugged. “Maybe a bit more jumpy than usual, but…”\\n“But?”\\n“Nothing.”\\nI sensed there was more. I waited.\\nAnd after a moment, Max went on, “I don’t know how much you know\\nabout their relationship.”\\n“Only what I read in the papers.”\\n“And what did you read?”\\n“That they were happy.”\\n“Happy?” Max smiled coldly. “Oh, they were happy. Gabriel did\\neverything he could to make her happy.”\\n“I see.” But I didn’t see. I didn’t know where Max was going.\\nI must have looked puzzled because he shrugged. “I’m not going to\\nelaborate. If it’s gossip you’re after, talk to Jean-Felix, not me.”\\n“Jean-Felix?”\\n“Jean-Felix Martin. Alicia’s gallerist. They’d known each other for years.\\nAs thick as thieves. Never liked him much, if I’m honest.”\\n“I’m not interested in gossip.” I made a mental note to talk to Jean-Felix\\nas soon as possible. “I’m more interested in your personal opinion. May I\\nask you a direct question?”\\n“I thought you just did.”\\n“Did you like Alicia?”\\nMax looked at me expressionlessly as he spoke. “Of course I did.”\\nI didn’t believe him. “I sense you’re wearing two different hats. The\\nlawyer’s hat, which is understandably discreet. And the brother’s hat. It’s\\nthe brother I came to see.”\\nThere was a pause. I wondered if Max was about to ask me to leave. He\\nseemed about to say something but changed his mind. Then he suddenly left the desk and went to the window. He opened it. There was a blast of cold\\nair. Max breathed in deeply, as if the room had been stifling him.\\nFinally he said in a low voice, “The truth is … I hated her … I loathed\\nher.”\\nI didn’t say anything. I waited for him to go on.\\nHe kept looking out the window and said slowly, “Gabriel wasn’t just my\\nbrother, he was my best friend. He was the kindest man you ever met. Too\\nkind. And all his talent, his goodness, his passion for life—wiped out,\\nbecause of that bitch. It wasn’t just his life she destroyed—it was mine too.\\nThank God my parents didn’t live to see it.” Max choked up, suddenly\\nemotional.\\nIt was hard not to sense his pain, and I felt sorry for him. “It must have\\nbeen extremely difficult for you to organize Alicia’s defense.”\\nMax shut the window and returned to the desk. He had regained control\\nof himself. He was wearing the lawyer’s hat again. Neutral, balanced,\\nemotionless.\\nHe shrugged. “It’s what Gabriel would have wanted. He wanted the best\\nfor Alicia, always. He was mad about her. She was just mad.”\\n“You think she was insane?”\\n“You tell me—you’re her shrink.”\\n“What do you think?”\\n“I know what I observed.”\\n“And what was that?”\\n“Mood swings. Rages. Violent fits. She’d break things, smash stuff up.\\nGabriel told me she threatened to murder him on several occasions. I should\\nhave listened, done something—after she tried to kill herself, I should have\\nintervened, insisted she got some help. But I didn’t. Gabriel was determined\\nto protect her, and like an idiot, I let him.”\\nMax sighed and checked his watch—a cue for me to wrap up the\\nconversation.\\nBut I just stared at him blankly. “Alicia tried to kill herself? What do you\\nmean? When? You mean after the murder?”\\nMax shook his head. “No, several years before that. You don’t know? I\\nassumed you knew.”\\n“When was this?”\\n“After her father died. She took an overdose … pills or something. I can’t\\nremember exactly. She had a kind of breakdown.” I was about to press him further when the door opened. The receptionist\\nappeared and spoke in a sniffly voice. “Darling, we should go. We’ll be\\nlate.”\\n“Right. Coming, dear.”\\nThe door shut. Max stood up, giving me an apologetic glance. “We have\\ntheater tickets.” I must have looked startled, because he laughed. “We—\\nTanya and I—were married last year.”\\n“Oh. I see.”\\n“Gabriel’s death brought us together. I couldn’t have gotten through it\\nwithout her.”\\nMax’s phone rang, distracting him.\\nI nodded at him to take the call. “Thank you, you’ve been a great help.”\\nI slipped out of the office. I took a closer look at Tanya in reception—she\\nwas blond, pretty, rather petite. She blew her nose, and I noticed the large\\ndiamond on her wedding finger.\\nTo my surprise, she got up and walked toward me, frowning. She spoke\\nurgently in a low voice. “If you want to know about Alicia, talk to her\\ncousin, Paul—he knows her better than anyone.”\\n“I tried calling her aunt, Lydia Rose. She wasn’t particularly\\nforthcoming.”\\n“Forget Lydia. Go to Cambridge. Talk to Paul. Ask him about Alicia and\\nthe night after the accident, and—”\\nThe office door opened. Tanya immediately fell silent. Max emerged and\\nshe hurried over to him, smiling broadly.\\n“Ready, darling?” she asked.\\nTanya was smiling, but she sounded nervous. She’s afraid of Max, I\\nthought. I wondered why. CHAPTER THIRTEEN\\nAlicia Berenson’s Diary\\nJULY 22\\nI hate the fact there’s a gun in the house.\\nWe had another argument about it last night. At least I thought that’s what\\nwe were fighting about—I’m not so sure now.\\nGabriel said it was my fault we argued. I suppose it was. I hated seeing him\\nso upset, looking at me with hurt eyes. I hate causing him pain—and yet\\nsometimes I desperately want to hurt him, and I don’t know why.\\nHe said I came home in a horrible mood. That I marched upstairs and\\nstarted screaming at him. Perhaps I did. I suppose I was upset. I’m not\\naltogether sure what happened. I had just gotten back from the park. I don’t\\nremember much of the walk—I was daydreaming, thinking about work,\\nabout the Jesus picture. I remember walking past a house on my way home.\\nTwo boys were playing with a hose. They couldn’t have been older than\\nseven or eight. The older boy was spraying the younger with a jet of water,\\na rainbow of color sparkling in the light. A perfect rainbow. The younger\\nboy stretched out his hands, laughing. I walked past and I realized my\\ncheeks were wet with tears.\\nI dismissed it then, but thinking about it now, it seems obvious. I don’t want\\nto admit the truth to myself—that a huge part of my life is missing. That I’ve\\ndenied I want children, pretending I have no interest in them, that all I care\\nabout is my art. And it’s not true. It’s just an excuse—the truth is I’m scared\\nto have kids. I am not to be trusted with them.\\nNot with my mother’s blood running through my veins.\\nThat’s what was on my mind, consciously or unconsciously, when I got\\nhome. Gabriel was right, I was in a bad state. But I never would have exploded if I hadn’t found him cleaning the gun. It\\nupsets me so much that he has it. And it hurts me he won’t get rid of it, no\\nmatter how many times I beg him. He always says the same thing—that it\\nwas one of his father’s old rifles from their farm and he gave it him when he\\nwas sixteen, that it has sentimental value and blah blah blah. I don’t believe\\nhim. I think there’s another reason he’s keeping it. I said so. And Gabriel\\nsaid there was nothing wrong with wanting to be safe—wanting to protect\\nhis house and wife. What if someone broke in?\\n“Then we call the police,” I said. “We don’t fucking shoot them!”\\nI had raised my voice, but he raised his louder, and before I knew it, we\\nwere yelling at each other. Maybe I was a bit out of control. But I was only\\nreacting to him—there’s an aggressive side to Gabriel, a part of him I only\\nglimpse occasionally, and when I do, it scares me. For those brief moments\\nit’s like living with a stranger. And that’s terrifying.\\nWe didn’t speak for the rest of the evening. We went to bed in silence.\\nThis morning we had sex and made up. We always seem to resolve our\\nproblems in bed. It’s easier, somehow—when you’re naked and half-asleep\\nunder the covers—to whisper, “I’m sorry,” and mean it. All defenses and\\nbullshit justifications are discarded, lying in a heap on the floor with our\\nclothes.\\n“Maybe we should make it a rule to always conduct arguments in bed.” He\\nkissed me. “I love you. I’ll get rid of the rifle, I promise.”\\n“No,” I said. “It doesn’t matter, forget it. It’s okay. Really.”\\nGabriel kissed me again and pulled me close. I held on to him, laying my\\nnaked body on his. I closed my eyes and stretched out on a friendly rock\\nthat was molded to my shape. And I felt at peace at last.\\nJULY 23\\nI’m writing this in Café de l’Artista. I come here most days now. I keep\\nfeeling the need to get out of the house. When I’m around other people,\\neven if it’s only the bored waitress in here, I feel connected to the world\\nsomehow, like a human being.\\nOtherwise I’m in danger of ceasing to exist. Like I might disappear. Sometimes I wish I could disappear—like tonight. Gabriel has invited his\\nbrother over for dinner. He sprung it on me this morning.\\n“We’ve not seen Max in ages,” he said. “Not since Joel’s housewarming.\\nI’ll do a barbecue.” Gabriel looked at me strangely. “You don’t mind, do\\nyou?”\\n“Why would I mind?”\\nGabriel laughed. “You’re such a bad liar, you know that? I can read your\\nface like a very short book.”\\n“And what does it say?”\\n“That you don’t like Max. You never have.”\\n“That’s not true.” I could feel myself going red. I shrugged and looked\\naway. “Of course I like Max. It’ll be nice to see him. When are you going to\\nsit for me again? I need to finish the picture.”\\nGabriel smiled. “How about this weekend? And about the painting—do me\\na favor. Don’t show Max, all right? I don’t want him to see me as Jesus—I’ll\\nnever live it down.”\\n“Max won’t see it. It’s not ready yet.”\\nAnd even if it were, Max is the last person I want in my studio. I thought\\nthat but didn’t say it.\\nI’m dreading going home now. I want to stay here in this air-conditioned\\ncafé and hide until Max has left. But the waitress is already making little\\nimpatient noises and emphatically checking her watch. I’ll be kicked out\\nsoon. And that means short of wandering the streets all night like a mad\\nperson, I have no choice but to go home and face the music. And face Max.\\nJULY 24\\nI’m back in the café. Someone was sitting at my table, and the waitress gave\\nme a sympathetic look—at least I think that’s what she was communicating,\\na sense of solidarity, but I could be wrong. I took another table, facing in,\\nnot out, by the air-conditioning unit. There’s not much light—it’s cold and\\ndark, which suits my mood.\\nLast night was awful. Worse than I thought it would be. I didn’t recognize Max when he arrived—I don’t think I’ve ever seen him\\nout of a suit before. He looked a bit silly in shorts. He was sweating\\nprofusely after the walk from the station—his bald head was red and shiny,\\nand dark patches were spreading out from under his armpits. He wouldn’t\\nmeet my eye at first. Or was it me, not looking at him?\\nHe made a big thing of the house, saying how different it looked, how long\\nit was since we’d invited him that he was starting to think we’d never ask\\nagain. Gabriel kept apologizing, saying how busy we’d been, me with the\\nupcoming exhibition and him with work, and we’d not seen anyone. Gabriel\\nwas smiling, but I could tell he felt annoyed that Max had made such a\\npoint of it.\\nI kept up a pretty good front at first. I was waiting for the right moment.\\nAnd then I found it. Max and Gabriel went into the garden and got the\\nbarbecue going. I hung around in the kitchen on the pretext of making a\\nsalad. I knew Max would make an excuse to come and find me. And I was\\nright. After about five minutes, I heard his heavy, thudding footsteps. He\\ndoesn’t walk at all like Gabriel—Gabriel is so silent, he’s like a cat, I never\\nhear him moving around the house at all.\\n“Alicia,” Max said.\\nI realized my hands were shaking as I chopped the tomatoes. I put down the\\nknife. I turned around to face him.\\nMax held up his empty beer bottle and smiled. He still wouldn’t look at me.\\n“I’ve come for another.”\\nI nodded. I didn’t say anything. He opened the fridge and took out another\\nbeer. He looked around for the opener. I pointed at it on the counter.\\nHe gave me a funny smile as he opened the beer, like he was going to say\\nsomething. But I beat him to it:\\n“I’m going to tell Gabriel what happened. I thought you should know.”\\nMax stopped smiling. He looked at me for the first time, with snakelike eyes.\\n“What?”\\n“I’m telling Gabriel. About what happened at Joel’s.”\\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\\n“Don’t you?” “I don’t remember. I was rather drunk, I’m afraid.”\\n“Bullshit.”\\n“It’s true.”\\n“You don’t remember kissing me? You don’t remember grabbing me?”\\n“Alicia, don’t.”\\n“Don’t what? Make a big deal out of it? You assaulted me.”\\nI could feel myself getting angry. It was an effort to control my voice and\\nnot start shouting. I glanced out the window. Gabriel was at the end of the\\ngarden, standing over the barbecue. The smoke and the hot air distorted my\\nview of him, and he was all bent out of shape.\\n“He looks up to you,” I said. “You’re his older brother. He’s going to be so\\nhurt when I tell him.”\\n“Then don’t. There’s nothing to tell him.”\\n“He needs to know the truth. He needs know what his brother is really like.\\nYou—”\\nBefore I could finish, Max grabbed my arm hard and pulled me toward him.\\nI lost my balance and fell onto him. He raised his fist and I thought he was\\ngoing to punch me. “I love you,” he said, “I love you, I love you, I love—”\\nBefore I could react, he kissed me. I tried to pull away but he wouldn’t let\\nme. I felt his rough lips all over mine, and his tongue pushing its way into\\nmy mouth. Instinct took over.\\nI bit his tongue as hard as I could.\\nMax cried out and shoved me away. When he looked up, his mouth was full\\nof blood.\\n“Fucking bitch!” His voice was garbled, his teeth red. He glared at me like\\na wounded animal.\\nI can’t believe Max is Gabriel’s brother. He has none of Gabriel’s fine\\nqualities, none of his decency, none of his kindness. Max disgusts me—and I\\nsaid so.\\n“Alicia, don’t say anything to Gabriel,” he said. “I mean it. I’m warning\\nyou.” I didn’t say another word. I could taste his blood on my tongue, so I turned\\non the tap and rinsed my mouth until it was gone. Then I walked out into the\\ngarden.\\nOccasionally I sensed Max staring at me over dinner. I’d look up and catch\\nhis eye and he’d look away. I didn’t eat anything. The thought of eating\\nmade me sick. I kept tasting his blood in my mouth.\\nI don’t know what to do. I don’t want to lie to Gabriel. Nor do I want to\\nkeep it a secret. But if I tell Gabriel, he’ll never speak to Max again. It\\nwould devastate him to know he’d misplaced his trust in his brother.\\nBecause he does trust Max. He idolizes him. And he shouldn’t.\\nI don’t believe that Max is in love with me. I believe he hates Gabriel, that’s\\nall. I think he’s madly jealous of him—and he wants to take everything that\\nbelongs to Gabriel, which includes me. But now that I’ve stood up to him, I\\ndon’t think he’ll bother me again—at least I hope not. Not for a while,\\nanyway.\\nSo, for the moment, I’m going to remain silent.\\nOf course, Gabriel can read me like a book. Or maybe I’m just not a very\\ngood actress. Last night, as we were getting ready for bed, he said I’d been\\nweird the whole time Max was there.\\n“I was just tired.”\\n“No, it was more than that. You were so distant. You might have made more\\nof an effort. We barely ever see him. I don’t know why you have such a\\nproblem with him.”\\n“I don’t. It was nothing to do with Max. I was distracted, I was thinking\\nabout work. I’m behind with the exhibition—it’s all I can think about.” I\\nsaid this with as much conviction as I could muster.\\nGabriel gave me a disbelieving look but he let it go, for the moment. I’ll\\nhave to face it again next time we see Max—but something tells me that\\nwon’t be for a while.\\nI feel better for having written this down. I feel safer, somehow, having it on\\npaper. It means I have some evidence—some proof.\\nIf it ever comes to that. JULY 26\\nIt’s my birthday today. I’m thirty-three years old.\\nIt’s strange—it’s older than I ever saw myself as being; my imagination only\\never extended this far. I’ve outlived my mother now—it’s an unsteady\\nfeeling, being older than she was. She got to thirty-two, and then she\\nstopped. Now I’ve outlived her, and won’t stop. I will grow older and older\\n—but she won’t.\\nGabriel was so sweet this morning—he kissed me awake and presented me\\nwith thirty-three red roses. They were beautiful. He pricked his finger on\\none of the thorns. A bloodred teardrop. It was perfect.\\nThen he took me for a picnic in the park for breakfast. The sun was barely\\nup, so the heat wasn’t unbearable. A cool breeze was coming off the water\\nand the air smelled of cut grass. We lay by the pond under a weeping\\nwillow, on the blue blanket we bought in Mexico. The willow branches\\nformed a canopy over us, and the sun burned hazily through the leaves. We\\ndrank champagne and ate small sweet tomatoes with smoked salmon and\\nslivers of bread. Somewhere, in the back of my mind, was a vague feeling of\\nfamiliarity, a nagging sense of déjà vu I couldn’t quite place. Perhaps it was\\nsimply a recollection of childhood stories, fairy tales, and magical trees\\nbeing gateways to other worlds. Perhaps it was something more prosaic.\\nAnd then the memory came back to me:\\nI saw myself when very young, sitting under the branches of the willow tree\\nin our garden in Cambridge. I’d spend hours hiding there. I may not have\\nbeen a happy child, but during the time I spent under the willow tree, I felt a\\nsimilar contentment to lying here with Gabriel. And now it was as if the\\npast and the present were coexisting simultaneously in one perfect moment.\\nI wanted that moment to last forever. Gabriel fell asleep, and I sketched\\nhim, trying to capture the dappled sunlight on his face. I did a better job\\nwith his eyes this time. It was easier because they were closed—but at least\\nI got their shape right. He looked like a little boy, curled up asleep and\\nbreathing gently, crumbs around his mouth.\\nWe finished the picnic, went home, and had sex. And Gabriel held me in his\\narms and said something astonishing: “Alicia, darling, listen. There’s something on my mind I want to talk to you\\nabout.”\\nThe way he said it made me instantly nervous. I braced myself, fearing the\\nworst. “Go on.”\\n“I want us to have a baby.”\\nIt took me a moment to speak. I was so taken aback I didn’t know what to\\nsay.\\n“But—you didn’t want any children. You said—”\\n“Forget that. I changed my mind. I want us to have a child together. Well?\\nWhat do you say?”\\nGabriel looked at me hopefully, expectantly, waiting for my response. I felt\\nmy eyes welling up with tears. “Yes,” I said, “yes, yes, yes…”\\nWe hugged each other and cried and laughed.\\nHe’s in bed now, asleep. I had to sneak away and write all this down—I\\nwant to remember this day for the rest of my life. Every single second of it.\\nI feel joyous. I feel full of hope. CHAPTER FOURTEEN\\nI KEPT THINKING ABOUT what Max Berenson had said—about Alicia’s suicide\\nattempt, following her father’s death. There was no mention of it in her file,\\nand I wondered why.\\nI rang Max the next day, catching him just as he was leaving the office.\\n“I just want to ask you a couple more questions if you don’t mind.”\\n“I’m literally walking out of the door.”\\n“This won’t take long.”\\nMax sighed and lowered the phone to say something unintelligible to\\nTanya.\\n“Five minutes,” he said. “That’s all you get.”\\n“Thanks, I appreciate it. You mentioned Alicia’s suicide attempt. I was\\nwondering, which hospital treated her?”\\n“She wasn’t admitted to hospital.”\\n“She wasn’t?”\\n“No. She recovered at home. My brother looked after her.”\\n“But—surely she saw a doctor? It was an overdose, you said?”\\n“Yes. And of course Gabriel got a doctor over. And he … the doctor—\\nagreed to keep it quiet.”\\n“Who was the doctor? Do you remember his name?”\\nThere was a pause as Max thought for a moment. “I’m sorry, I can’t tell\\nyou.… I can’t recall.”\\n“Was it their GP?”\\n“No, I’m sure it wasn’t. My brother and I shared a GP. I remember\\nGabriel made a point of asking me not to mention it to him.”\\n“And you’re sure you can’t remember a name?”\\n“I’m sorry. Is that all? I have to go.”\\n“Just one more thing … I was curious about the terms of Gabriel’s will.”\\nA slight intake of breath, and Max’s tone instantly sharpened. “His will?\\nI really don’t see the relevance—” “Was Alicia the main beneficiary?”\\n“I must say, I find that rather an odd question.”\\n“Well, I’m trying to understand—”\\n“Understand what?” Max went on without waiting for a reply, sounding\\nannoyed. “I was the main beneficiary. Alicia had inherited a great deal of\\nmoney from her father, so Gabriel felt she was well provided for. And so he\\nleft the bulk of his estate to me. Of course, he had no idea his estate would\\nbecome so valuable after his death. Is that it?”\\n“And what about Alicia’s will? When she dies, who inherits?”\\n“That,” Max said firmly, “is more than I can tell you. And I sincerely\\nhope this will be our last conversation.”\\nThere was a click as he hung up. But something in his tone told me this\\nwouldn’t be the last I’d hear from Max Berenson.\\nI didn’t have to wait long.\\n*   *   *\\nDiomedes called me into his office after lunch. He looked up when I walked\\nin but didn’t smile. “What is the matter with you?”\\n“With me?”\\n“Don’t play the idiot. You know who I had a call from this morning?\\nMax Berenson. He says you contacted him twice and asked a lot of personal\\nquestions.”\\n“I asked him for some information about Alicia. He seemed fine with it.”\\n“Well, he’s not fine now. He’s calling it harassment.”\\n“Oh, come on—”\\n“The last thing we need is a lawyer making a fuss. Everything you do\\nmust be within the confines of the unit, and under my supervision.\\nUnderstood?”\\nI was angry, but I nodded. I stared at the floor like a sullen teenager.\\nDiomedes responded appropriately, giving me a paternal pat on the\\nshoulder. “Theo. Let me give you some advice. You’re going about this the\\nwrong way. You’re asking questions, searching for clues, like it’s a\\ndetective story.” He laughed and shook his head. “You won’t get to it like\\nthat.”\\n“Get to what?”\\n“The truth. Remember Bion: ‘No memory—no desire.’ No agenda—as a\\ntherapist, your only goal is to be present and receptive to your feelings as you sit with her. That’s all you need to do. The rest will take care of itself.”\\n“I know. You’re right.”\\n“Yes, I am. And don’t let me hear you’ve been making any more visits to\\nAlicia’s relations, understood?”\\n“You have my word.” CHAPTER FIFTEEN\\nTHAT AFTERNOON I WENT TO CAMBRIDGE, to visit Alicia’s cousin, Paul Rose.\\nAs the train approached the station, the landscape flattened out and the\\nfields let in an expanse of cold blue light. I felt glad to be out of London—\\nthe sky was less oppressive, and I could breathe more easily.\\nI left the train along with a trickle of students and tourists, using the map\\non my phone to guide me. The streets were quiet; I could hear my footsteps\\non the pavement echoing. Abruptly the road stopped. A wasteland lay\\nahead, muddy earth and grass leading to the river.\\nOnly one house stood alone by the river. Obstinate and imposing, like a\\nlarge red brick thrust into the mud. It was ugly, a Victorian monster. The\\nwalls were overgrown with ivy, and the garden had been overtaken by\\nplants, weeds mostly. I got the sense of nature encroaching, reclaiming\\nterritory that had once been hers. This was the house where Alicia had been\\nborn. It was where she spent the first eighteen years of her life. Within these\\nwalls her personality had been formed: the roots of her adult life, all causes\\nand subsequent choices, were buried here. Sometimes it’s hard to grasp why\\nthe answers to the present lie in the past. A simple analogy might be\\nhelpful: a leading psychiatrist in the field of sexual abuse once told me she\\nhad, in thirty years of extensive work with pedophiles, never met one who\\nhadn’t himself been abused as a child. This doesn’t mean that all abused\\nchildren go on to become abusers, but it is impossible for someone who was\\nnot abused to become an abuser. No one is born evil. As Winnicott put it,\\n“A baby cannot hate the mother, without the mother first hating the baby.”\\nAs babies, we are innocent sponges, blank slates, with only the most basic\\nneeds present: to eat, shit, love, and be loved. But something goes wrong,\\ndepending on the circumstances into which we are born, and the house in\\nwhich we grow up. A tormented, abused child can never take revenge in\\nreality, as she is powerless and defenseless, but she can—and must—harbor\\nvengeful fantasies in her imagination. Rage, like fear, is reactive. Something bad happened to Alicia, probably early in her childhood, to\\nprovoke the murderous impulses that emerged all those years later.\\nWhatever the provocation, not everyone in this world would have picked up\\nthe gun and fired it point-blank into Gabriel’s face—most people could not.\\nThat Alicia did so points to something disordered in her internal world.\\nThat’s why it was crucial for me to understand what life had been like for\\nher in this house, to find out what happened to shape her, make her into the\\nperson she became—a person capable of murder.\\nI wandered farther into the overgrown garden, through the weeds and\\nwaving wildflowers, and made my way along the side of the house. At the\\nback was a large willow tree—a beautiful tree, majestic, with long bare\\nbranches sweeping to the ground. I pictured Alicia as a child playing around\\nit and in the secret, magical world beneath its branches. I smiled.\\nThen I felt uneasy suddenly. I could sense someone’s eyes on me.\\nI looked up at the house. A face appeared at an upstairs window. An ugly\\nface, an old woman’s face, pressed against the glass—staring straight at me.\\nI felt a strange, inexplicable shiver of fear.\\nI didn’t hear the footsteps behind me until too late. There was a bang—a\\nheavy thud—and a stab of pain at the back of my head.\\nEverything went black. CHAPTER SIXTEEN\\nI WOKE UP ON THE HARD, cold ground, on my back. My first sensation was\\npain. My head was throbbing, stabbing, as if my skull had been cracked\\nopen. I reached up and gingerly touched the back of my head.\\n“No blood,” said a voice. “But you’ll have a nasty bruise tomorrow. Not\\nto mention a cracking headache.”\\nI looked up and saw Paul Rose for the first time. He was standing above\\nme, holding a baseball bat. He was about my age, but taller, and broad with\\nit. He had a boyish face and a shock of red hair, the same color as Alicia’s.\\nHe reeked of whiskey.\\nI tried to sit up but couldn’t quite manage it.\\n“Better stay there. Recover for a sec.”\\n“I think I’ve got concussion.”\\n“Possibly.”\\n“What the fuck did you do that for?”\\n“What did you expect, mate? I thought you were a burglar.”\\n“Well, I’m not.”\\n“I know that now. I went through your wallet. You’re a psychotherapist.”\\nHe reached into his back pocket and pulled out my wallet. He tossed it at\\nme. It landed on my chest. I reached for it.\\n“I saw your ID. You’re at that hospital—the Grove?”\\nI nodded and the movement made my head throb. “Yes.”\\n“Then you know who I am.”\\n“Alicia’s cousin?”\\n“Paul Rose.” He held out his hand. “Here. Let me help you up.”\\nHe pulled me to my feet with surprising ease. He was strong. I was\\nunsteady on my feet. “You could have killed me,” I muttered.\\nPaul shrugged. “You could have been armed. You were trespassing. What\\ndid you expect? Why are you here?”\\n“I came to see you.” I grimaced in pain. “I wish I hadn’t.” “Come in, sit down for a second.”\\nI was in too much pain to do anything other than go where he led me. My\\nhead was throbbing with every step. We went inside the back door.\\nThe inside of the house was just as dilapidated as the outside. The\\nkitchen walls were covered with an orange geometric design that looked\\nforty years out-of-date. The wallpaper was coming away from the wall in\\npatches, curling, twisting, and blackening as if it were catching fire.\\nMummified insects were hanging suspended from cobwebs in the corners\\nof the ceiling. The dust was so thick on the floor, it looked like a dirty\\ncarpet. And an underlying odor of cat piss made me feel sick. I counted at\\nleast five cats around the kitchen, sleeping on chairs and surfaces. On the\\nfloor, open plastic bags overflowed with stinking tins of cat food.\\n“Sit down. I’ll make some tea.” Paul leaned the baseball bat against the\\nwall, by the door. I kept my eye on it. I didn’t feel safe around him.\\nPaul handed me a cracked mug full of tea. “Drink this.”\\n“You have any painkillers?”\\n“I’ve got some aspirin somewhere, I’ll have a look. Here.” He showed\\nme a bottle of whiskey. “This’ll help.”\\nHe poured some of the whiskey into the mug. I sipped it. It was hot,\\nsweet, and strong. There was a pause as Paul drank his tea, staring at me—I\\nwas reminded of Alicia and that piercing gaze of hers.\\n“How is she?” he asked eventually. He continued before I could reply,\\n“I’ve not been to see her. It’s not easy getting away.… Mum’s not well—I\\ndon’t like to leave her alone.”\\n“I see. When was the last time you saw Alicia?”\\n“Oh, years. Not for a long while. We lost touch. I was at their wedding,\\nand I saw her a couple of times after that, but … Gabriel was quite\\npossessive, I think. She stopped calling, anyway, once they got married.\\nStopped visiting. Mum was pretty hurt, to be honest.”\\nI didn’t speak. I could hardly think, with the throbbing in my head. I\\ncould feel him watching me.\\n“So what did you want to see me for?”\\n“Just some questions … I wanted to ask you about Alicia. About … her\\nchildhood.”\\nPaul nodded and poured some whiskey into his mug. He seemed to be\\nrelaxing now; the whiskey was having an effect on me too, taking the edge off my pain, and I was thinking better. Stay on track, I told myself. Get\\nsome facts. Then get the hell out of here.\\n“You grew up together?”\\nPaul nodded. “Mum and I moved in when my dad died. I was about eight\\nor nine. It was only meant to be temporary, I think—but then Alicia’s\\nmother was killed in the accident. So Mum stayed on—to take care of\\nAlicia and Uncle Vernon.”\\n“Vernon Rose—Alicia’s father?”\\n“Right.”\\n“And Vernon died here a few years ago?”\\n“Yes. Several years ago.” Paul frowned. “He killed himself. Hanged\\nhimself. Upstairs, in the attic. I found the body.”\\n“That must have been terrible.”\\n“Yeah, it was tough—on Alicia mostly. Come to think of it, that’s the last\\ntime I saw her. Uncle Vernon’s funeral. She was in a bad way.” Paul stood\\nup. “You want another drink?”\\nI tried to refuse but he kept talking as he poured more whiskey. “I never\\nbelieved it, you know. That she killed Gabriel—it didn’t make any sense to\\nme.”\\n“Why not?”\\n“Well, she wasn’t like that at all. She wasn’t a violent person.”\\nShe is now, I thought. But I didn’t say anything. Paul sipped his whiskey.\\n“She’s still not talking?”\\n“No. She’s still not talking.”\\n“It doesn’t make sense. None of it. You know, I think she was—”\\nWe were interrupted by a thumping, a banging on the floor above. There\\nwas a muffled voice, a woman’s voice; her words were unintelligible.\\nPaul leapt to his feet. “Just a sec.” He walked out. He hurried to the foot\\nof the stairs. He raised his voice. “Everything all right, Mum?”\\nA mumbled response that I couldn’t understand came from upstairs.\\n“What? Oh, all right. Just—just a minute.” He sounded uneasy.\\nPaul glanced at me across the hallway, frowning. He nodded at me. “She\\nwants you to go up.” CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\\nSTEADIER ON MY FEET, but still feeling faint, I followed Paul as he thudded\\nup the dusty staircase.\\nLydia Rose was waiting at the top. I recognized her scowling face from\\nthe window. She had long white hair, spreading across her shoulders like a\\nspider’s web. She was enormously overweight—a swollen neck, fleshy\\nforearms, massive legs like tree trunks. She was leaning heavily on her\\nwalking stick, which was buckling under her weight and looked like it\\nmight give way at any moment.\\n“Who is he? Who is he?”\\nHer shrill question was directed to Paul, even though she was staring at\\nme. She didn’t take her eyes off me. Again, the same intense gaze I\\nrecognized from Alicia.\\nPaul spoke in a low voice. “Mum. Don’t get upset. He’s Alicia’s\\ntherapist, that’s all. From the hospital. He’s here to talk to me.”\\n“You? What does he want to talk to you for? What have you done?”\\n“He just wants to find out a bit about Alicia.”\\n“He’s a journalist, you fucking idiot.” Her voice approached a shriek.\\n“Get him out!”\\n“He’s not a journalist. I’ve seen his ID, all right? Now, come on, Mum,\\nplease. Let’s get you back to bed.”\\nGrumbling, she allowed herself to be guided back into her bedroom. Paul\\nnodded at me to follow.\\nLydia flopped back with a deep thud. The bed quivered as it absorbed her\\nweight. Paul adjusted her pillows. An ancient cat lay asleep by her feet, the\\nugliest cat I’d ever seen—battle scarred, bald in places, one ear bitten off. It\\nwas growling in its sleep.\\nI glanced around the room. It was full of junk—stacks of old magazines\\nand yellowing newspapers, piles of old clothes. An oxygen canister stood\\nby the wall, and a cake tin full of medications was on the bedside table. I could feel Lydia’s hostile eyes on me the whole time. There was\\nmadness in her gaze; I felt quite sure of that.\\n“What does he want?” Her eyes darted up and down feverishly as she\\nsized me up. “Who is he?”\\n“I just told you, Mum. He wants to know some background on Alicia, to\\nhelp him treat her. He’s her psychotherapist.”\\nLydia left no doubt about her opinion of psychotherapists. She turned her\\nhead, cleared her throat—and spat onto the floor in front of me.\\nPaul groaned. “Mum, please—”\\n“Shut up.” Lydia glared at me. “Alicia doesn’t deserve to be in hospital.”\\n“No?” I said. “Where should she be?”\\n“Where do you think? Prison.” Lydia eyed me scornfully. “You want to\\nhear about Alicia? I’ll tell you about her. She’s a little bitch. She always\\nwas, even as a child.”\\nI listened, my head throbbing, as Lydia went on, with mounting anger:\\n“My poor brother, Vernon. He never recovered from Eva’s death. I took\\ncare of him. I took care of Alicia. And was she grateful?”\\nObviously, no response was no required. Not that Lydia waited for one.\\n“You know how Alicia repaid me? All my kindness? Do you know what\\nshe did to me?”\\n“Mum, please—”\\n“Shut up, Paul!’ Lydia turned to me. I was surprised how much anger\\nwas in her voice. “The bitch painted me. She painted me, without my\\nknowledge or permission. I went to her exhibition—and there it was,\\nhanging there. Vile, disgusting—an obscene mockery.”\\nLydia was trembling with anger, and Paul looked concerned. He gave me\\nan unhappy glance. “Maybe it’s better if you go now, mate. It’s not good for\\nMum to get upset.”\\nI nodded. Lydia Rose was not well, no doubt about that. I was more than\\nhappy to escape.\\nI left the house and made my way back to the train station, with a swollen\\nhead and a splitting headache. What a fucking waste of time. I’d found out\\nnothing—except it was obvious why Alicia had gotten out of that house as\\nsoon as she could. It reminded me of my own escape from home at the age\\nof eighteen, fleeing my father. It was all too obvious who Alicia was\\nrunning away from—Lydia Rose. I thought about the painting Alicia had done of Lydia. “An obscene\\nmockery,” she called it. Well, time to pay a visit to Alicia’s gallery and find\\nout why the picture had upset her aunt so much.\\nAs I left Cambridge, my last thoughts were of Paul. I felt sorry for him,\\nhaving to live with that monstrous woman—be her unpaid slave. It was a\\nlonely life—I didn’t imagine he had many friends. Or a girlfriend. I\\nwouldn’t be surprised if he was still a virgin. Something about him\\nremained stunted, despite his size; something thwarted.\\nI had taken an instant and violent dislike to Lydia—probably because she\\nreminded me of my father. I would have ended up like Paul if I had stayed\\nin that house, if I had stayed with my parents in Surrey, at the beck and call\\nof a madman.\\nI felt depressed all the way back to London. Sad, tired, close to tears. I\\ncouldn’t tell if I was feeling Paul’s sadness—or my own. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\\nKATHY WAS OUT WHEN I GOT HOME.\\nI opened her laptop and tried to access her email—but with no luck. She\\nwas logged out.\\nI had to accept that she might never repeat her mistake. Would I keep\\nchecking ad nauseam, give in to obsession, driving myself mad? I had\\nenough self-awareness to appreciate the cliché I had become—the jealous\\nhusband—and the irony that Kathy was currently rehearsing Desdemona in\\nOthello hadn’t escaped me.\\nI should have forwarded the emails to myself that first night, as soon as\\nI’d read them. Then I’d have some actual physical evidence. That was my\\nmistake. As it was, I had begun questioning what I had seen. Was my\\nrecollection to be trusted? I’d been stoned out of my mind, after all—had I\\nmisunderstood what I had read? I found myself concocting outlandish\\ntheories to prove Kathy’s innocence. Maybe it was just an acting exercise—\\nshe was writing in character, in preparation for Othello. She had spent six\\nweeks speaking in an American accent when preparing for All My Sons. It\\nwas possible something similar was going on here. Except the emails were\\nsigned by Kathy—not Desdemona.\\nIf only I had imagined it all, then I could forget it, the way you forget a\\ndream—I could wake up and it would fade away. Instead I was trapped in\\nthis endless nightmare of mistrust, suspicion, paranoia. Although on the\\nsurface, little had changed. We still went for a walk together on Sunday. We\\nlooked like every other couple strolling in the park. Perhaps our silences\\nwere longer than usual, but they seemed comfortable enough. Under the\\nsilence, however, a fevered one-sided conversation was taking place in my\\nmind. I rehearsed a million questions. Why did she do it? How could she?\\nWhy say she loved me and marry me, fuck me, and share my bed—then lie\\nto my face, and keep lying, year after year? How long had it been going on?\\nDid she love this man? Was she going to leave me for him? I looked through her phone a couple of times when she was in the\\nshower, searching for text messages, but found nothing. If she’d received\\nany incriminating texts, she had deleted them. She wasn’t stupid,\\napparently, just occasionally careless.\\nIt was possible I’d never know the truth. I might never find out.\\nIn a way, I hoped I wouldn’t.\\nKathy peered at me as we sat on the couch after the walk. “Are you all\\nright?”\\n“What do you mean?”\\n“I don’t know. You seem a bit flat.”\\n“Today?”\\n“Not just today. Recently.”\\nI evaded her eyes. “Just work. I’ve got a lot on my mind.”\\nKathy nodded. A sympathetic squeeze of my hand. She was a good\\nactress. I could almost believe she cared.\\n“How are rehearsals going?”\\n“Better. Tony came up with some good ideas. We’re going to work late\\nnext week to go over them.”\\n“Right.”\\nI no longer believed a word she said. I analyzed every sentence, the way I\\nwould with a patient. I was looking for subtext, reading between the lines\\nfor nonverbal clues—subtle inflections, evasions, omissions. Lies.\\n“How is Tony?”\\n“Fine.” She shrugged, as if to indicate she couldn’t care less. I didn’t\\nbelieve that. She idolized Tony, her director, and was forever talking about\\nhim—at least she used to; she hadn’t mentioned him quite so much recently.\\nThey talked about plays and acting and the theater—a world beyond my\\nknowledge. I’d heard a lot about Tony, but only glimpsed him once, briefly,\\nwhen I went to meet Kathy after a rehearsal. I thought it odd that Kathy\\ndidn’t introduce us. He was married, and his wife was an actress; I got the\\nsense Kathy didn’t like her much. Perhaps his wife was jealous of their\\nrelationship, as I was. I suggested the four of us go out for dinner, but Kathy\\nhadn’t been particularly keen on the idea. Sometimes I wondered if she was\\ntrying to keep us apart.\\nI watched Kathy open her laptop. She angled the screen away from me as\\nshe typed. I could hear her fingers tapping. Who was she writing to? Tony?\\n“What are you doing?” I yawned. “Just emailing my cousin … She’s in Sydney now.”\\n“Is she? Send her my love.”\\n“I will.”\\nKathy typed for a moment longer, then stopped typing and put down the\\nlaptop. “I’m going to have a bath.”\\nI nodded. “Okay.”\\nShe gave me an amused look. “Cheer up, darling. Are you sure you’re\\nokay?”\\nI smiled and nodded. She stood up and walked out. I waited until I heard\\nthe bathroom door close, and the sound of running water. I slid over to\\nwhere she had been sitting. I reached for her laptop. My fingers were\\ntrembling as I opened it. I re-opened her browser—and went to her email\\nlog-in.\\nBut she’d logged out.\\nI pushed away the laptop with disgust. This must stop, I thought. This\\nway madness lies. Or was I mad already?\\nI was getting into bed, pulling back the covers, when Kathy walked into\\nthe bedroom, brushing her teeth.\\n“I forgot to tell you. Nicole is back in London next week.”\\n“Nicole?”\\n“You remember Nicole. We went to her going-away party.”\\n“Oh, yeah. I thought she moved to New York.”\\n“She did. And now she’s back.” A pause. “She wants me to meet her on\\nThursday … Thursday night after rehearsal.”\\nI don’t know what aroused my suspicion. Was it the way Kathy was\\nlooking in my direction but not making eye contact? I sensed she was lying.\\nI didn’t say anything. Neither did she. She disappeared from the door. I\\ncould hear her in the bathroom, spitting out the toothpaste and rinsing her\\nmouth.\\nPerhaps there was nothing to it. Perhaps it was entirely innocent and\\nKathy really was going to meet Nicole on Thursday.\\nPerhaps.\\nOnly one way to find out. CHAPTER NINETEEN\\nTHERE WERE NO QUEUES OUTSIDE Alicia’s gallery this time, as there had been\\nthat day, six years ago, when I had gone to see the Alcestis. A different artist\\nwas hanging in the window now, and despite his possible talent, he lacked\\nAlicia’s notoriety and subsequent ability to draw in the crowds.\\nAs I entered the gallery, I shivered; it was even colder in here than on the\\nstreet. There was something chilly about the atmosphere as well as the\\ntemperature; it smelled of exposed steel beams and bare concrete floors. It\\nwas soulless, I thought. Empty.\\nThe gallerist was sitting behind his desk. He stood up as I approached.\\nJean-Felix Martin was in his early forties, a handsome man with black\\neyes and hair, and a tight T-shirt with a red skull on it. I told him who I was\\nand why I had come. To my surprise, he seemed perfectly happy to talk\\nabout Alicia. He spoke with an accent. I asked if he was French.\\n“Originally—from Paris. But I’ve been here since I was a student—oh,\\ntwenty years at least. I think of myself more as British these days.” He\\nsmiled and gestured to a back room. “Come in, we can have a coffee.”\\n“Thanks.”\\nJean-Felix led me into an office that was essentially a storeroom,\\ncrowded with stacks of paintings.\\n“How is Alicia?” he asked, using a complicated-looking coffee machine.\\n“Is she still not talking?”\\nI shook my head. “No.”\\nHe nodded and sighed. “So sad. Won’t you sit down? What do you want\\nto know? I’ll do my best to answer truthfully.” Jean-Felix gave me a wry\\nsmile, tinged with curiosity. “Although I’m not entirely sure why you’ve\\ncome to me.”\\n“You and Alicia were close, weren’t you? Apart from your professional\\nrelationship—”\\n“Who told you that?” “Gabriel’s brother, Max Berenson. He suggested I talk to you.”\\nJean-Felix rolled his eyes. “Oh, so you saw Max, did you? What a bore.”\\nHe said it with such contempt I couldn’t help laughing. “You know Max\\nBerenson?”\\n“Well enough. Better than I’d like.” He handed me a small cup of coffee.\\n“Alicia and I were close. Very close. We knew each other for years—long\\nbefore she met Gabriel.”\\n“I didn’t realize that.”\\n“Oh, yes. We were at art school together. And after we graduated, we\\npainted together.”\\n“You mean you collaborated?”\\n“Well, not really.” Jean-Felix laughed. “I mean we painted walls together.\\nAs housepainters.”\\nI smiled. “Oh, I see.”\\n“It turned out I was better at painting walls than paintings. So I gave up,\\nabout the same time as Alicia’s art started to really take off. And when I\\nstarted running this place, it made sense for me to show Alicia’s work. It\\nwas a very natural, organic process.”\\n“Yes, it sounds like it. And what about Gabriel?”\\n“What about him?”\\nI sensed a prickliness here, a defensive reaction that told me this was an\\navenue worth exploring. “Well, I wonder how he fit into this dynamic.\\nPresumably you knew him quite well?”\\n“Not really.”\\n“No?”\\n“No.” Jean-Felix hesitated a second. “Gabriel didn’t take time to know\\nme. He was very … caught up in himself.”\\n“Sounds like you didn’t like him.”\\n“I didn’t particularly. I don’t think he liked me. In fact, I know he didn’t.”\\n“Why was that?”\\n“I have no idea.”\\n“Do you think perhaps he was jealous? Of your relationship with\\nAlicia?”\\nJean-Felix sipped his coffee and nodded. “Yeah, yes. Possibly.”\\n“He saw you as a threat, perhaps?”\\n“You tell me. Sounds like you have all the answers.” I took the hint. I didn’t push it any further. Instead I tried a different\\napproach. “You saw Alicia a few days before the murder, I believe?”\\n“Yes. I went to the house to see her.”\\n“Can you tell me a little about that?”\\n“Well, she had an exhibition coming up, and she was behind with her\\nwork. She was rightfully concerned.”\\n“You hadn’t seen any of the new work?”\\n“No. She’d been putting me off for ages. I thought I’d better check on\\nher. I expected she’d be in the studio at the end of the garden. But she\\nwasn’t.”\\n“No?”\\n“No, I found her in the house.”\\n“How did you get in?”\\nJean-Felix looked surprised by the question. “What?” I could tell he was\\nmaking some quick mental evaluation. Then he nodded. “Oh, I see what\\nyou mean. Well, there was a gate that led from the street to the back garden.\\nIt was usually unlocked. And from the garden I went into the kitchen\\nthrough the back door. Which was also unlocked.” He smiled. “You know,\\nyou sound more like a detective than a psychiatrist.”\\n“I’m a psychotherapist.”\\n“Is there a difference?”\\n“I’m just trying to understand Alicia’s mental state. How did you\\nexperience her mood?”\\nJean-Felix shrugged. “She seemed fine. A little stressed about work.”\\n“Is that all?”\\n“She didn’t look like she was going to shoot her husband in a few days, if\\nthat’s what you mean. She seemed—fine.” He drained his coffee and\\nhesitated as a thought struck him. “Would you like to see some of her\\npaintings?” Without waiting for a reply, Jean-Felix got up and walked to the\\ndoor, beckoning me to follow.\\n“Come on.” CHAPTER TWENTY\\nI FOLLOWED JEAN-FELIX into a storage room. He went over to a large case,\\npulled out a hinged rack, and lifted out three paintings wrapped in blankets.\\nHe propped them up. He carefully unwrapped each one. Then he stood back\\nand presented the first to me with a flourish.\\n“Voilà.”\\nI looked at it. The painting had the same photo-realistic quality as the rest\\nof Alicia’s work. It represented the car accident that killed her mother. A\\nwoman’s body was sitting in the wreck, slumped at the wheel. She was\\nbloodied and obviously dead. Her spirit, her soul, was rising from the\\ncorpse, like a large bird with yellow wings, soaring to the heavens.\\n“Isn’t it glorious?” Jean-Felix gazed at it. “All those yellows and reds and\\ngreens—I can quite get lost in it. It’s joyous.”\\nJoyous wasn’t the word I would have chosen. Unsettling, perhaps. I\\nwasn’t sure how I felt about it.\\nI moved on to the next picture. A painting of Jesus on the cross. Or was\\nit?\\n“It’s Gabriel,” Jean-Felix said. “It’s a good likeness.”\\nIt was Gabriel—but Gabriel portrayed as Jesus, crucified, hanging from\\nthe cross, blood trickling from his wounds, a crown of thorns on his head.\\nHis eyes were not downcast but staring out—unblinking, tortured,\\nunashamedly reproachful. They seemed to burn right through me. I peered\\nat the picture more closely—at the incongruous item strapped to Gabriel’s\\ntorso. A rifle.\\n“That’s the gun that killed him?”\\nJean-Felix nodded. “Yes. It belonged to him, I think.”\\n“And this was painted before his murder?”\\n“A month or so before. It shows you what was on Alicia’s mind, doesn’t\\nit?” Jean-Felix moved on to the third picture. It was a larger canvas than the\\nothers. “This one’s the best. Stand back to get a better look.” I did as he said and took a few paces back. Then I turned and looked. The\\nmoment I saw the painting, I let out an involuntary laugh.\\nThe subject was Alicia’s aunt, Lydia Rose. It was obvious why she had\\nbeen so upset by it. Lydia was nude, reclining on a tiny bed. The bed was\\nbuckling under her weight. She was enormously, monstrously fat—an\\nexplosion of flesh spilling over the bed and hitting the floor and spreading\\nacross the room, rippling and folding like waves of gray custard.\\n“Jesus. That’s cruel.”\\n“I think it’s quite lovely.” Jean-Felix looked at me with interest. “You\\nknow Lydia?”\\n“Yes, I went to visit her.”\\n“I see.” He smiled. “You have been doing your homework. I never met\\nLydia. Alicia hated her, you know.”\\n“Yes.” I stared at the painting. “Yes, I can see that.”\\nJean-Felix began carefully wrapping up the pictures again.\\n“And the Alcestis?” I said. “Can I see it?”\\n“Of course. Follow me.”\\nJean-Felix led me along the narrow passage to the end of the gallery.\\nThere the Alcestis occupied a wall to itself. It was just as beautiful and\\nmysterious as I remembered it. Alicia naked in the studio, in front of a\\nblank canvas, painting with a bloodred paintbrush. I studied Alicia’s\\nexpression. Again it defied interpretation. I frowned.\\n“She’s impossible to read.”\\n“That’s the point—it is a refusal to comment. It’s a painting about\\nsilence.”\\n“I’m not sure I understand what you mean.”\\n“Well, at the heart of all art lies a mystery. Alicia’s silence is her secret—\\nher mystery, in the religious sense. That’s why she named it Alcestis. Have\\nyou read it? By Euripides.” He gave me a curious look. “Read it. Then\\nyou’ll understand.”\\nI nodded—and then I noticed something in the painting I hadn’t before. I\\nleaned forward to look closely. A bowl of fruit sat on the table in the\\nbackground of the picture—a collection of apples and pears. On the red\\napples were some small white blobs—slippery white blobs creeping in and\\naround the fruit.\\nI pointed at them. “Are they…?”\\n“Maggots?” Jean-Felix nodded. “Yes.” “Fascinating. I wonder what that means.”\\n“It’s wonderful. A masterpiece. It really is.” Jean-Felix sighed and\\nglanced at me across the portrait. He lowered his voice as if Alicia were\\nable to hear us. “It’s a shame you didn’t know her then. She was the most\\ninteresting person I’ve ever met. Most people aren’t alive, you know, not\\nreally—sleepwalking their way through life. But Alicia was so intensely\\nalive.… It was hard to take your eyes off her.” Jean-Felix turned his head\\nback to the painting and gazed at Alicia’s naked body. “So beautiful.”\\nI looked back at Alicia’s body. But where Jean-Felix saw beauty, I saw\\nonly pain; I saw self-inflicted wounds, and scars of self-harm.\\n“Did she ever talk to you about her suicide attempt?”\\nI was fishing, but Jean-Felix took the bait. “Oh, you know about that?\\nYes, of course.”\\n“After her father died?”\\n“She went to pieces.” Jean-Felix nodded. “The truth is Alicia was hugely\\nfucked-up. Not as an artist, but as a person she was extremely vulnerable.\\nWhen her father hanged himself, it was too much. She couldn’t cope.”\\n“She must have loved him a great deal.”\\nJean-Felix gave a kind of strangled laugh. He looked at me as if I were\\nmad. “What are you talking about?”\\n“What do you mean?”\\n“Alicia didn’t love him. She hated her father. She despised him.”\\nI was taken aback by this. “Alicia told you that?”\\n“Of course she did. She hated him ever since she was a kid—ever since\\nher mother died.”\\n“But—then why try to commit suicide after his death? If it wasn’t grief,\\nwhat was it?”\\nJean-Felix shrugged. “Guilt, perhaps? Who knows?”\\nThere was something he wasn’t telling me, I thought. Something didn’t\\nfit. Something was wrong.\\nHis phone rang. “Excuse me a moment.” He turned away from me to\\nanswer it. A woman’s voice was on the other end. They talked for a\\nmoment, arranging a time to meet. “I’ll call you back, baby,” he said, and\\nhung up.\\nJean-Felix turned back to me. “Sorry about that.”\\n“That’s all right. Your girlfriend?”\\nHe smiled. “Just a friend … I have a lot of friends.” I’ll bet you do, I thought. I felt a flicker of dislike; I wasn’t sure why.\\nAs he showed me out, I asked a final question. “Just one more thing. Did\\nAlicia ever mention a doctor to you?”\\n“A doctor?”\\n“Apparently she saw a doctor, around the time of her suicide attempt. I’m\\ntrying to locate him.”\\n“Hmm.” Jean-Felix frowned. “Possibly—there was someone…”\\n“Can you remember his name?”\\nHe thought for a second and shook his head. “I’m sorry. No, I honestly\\ncan’t.”\\n“Well, if it comes to you, perhaps you can let me know?”\\n“Sure. But I doubt it.” He glanced at me and hesitated. “You want some\\nadvice?”\\n“I’d welcome some.”\\n“If you really want to get Alicia to talk … give her some paint and\\nbrushes. Let her paint. That’s the only way she’ll talk to you. Through her\\nart.”\\n“That’s an interesting idea.… You’ve been very helpful. Thank you, Mr.\\nMartin.”\\n“Call me Jean-Felix. And when you see Alicia, tell her I love her.”\\nHe smiled, and again I felt a slight repulsion: I found something about\\nJean-Felix hard to stomach. I could tell he had been genuinely close to\\nAlicia; they had known each other a long time, and he was obviously\\nattracted to her. Was he in love with her? I wasn’t so sure. I thought of Jean-\\nFelix’s face when he was looking at the Alcestis. Yes, love was in his eyes\\n—but love for the painting, not necessarily the painter. Jean-Felix coveted\\nthe art. Otherwise he would have visited Alicia at the Grove. He would\\nhave stuck by her—I knew that for a fact. A man never abandons a woman\\nlike that.\\nNot if he loves her. CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\\nI WENT INTO WATERSTONES on my way to work and bought a copy of Alcestis.\\nThe introduction said it was Euripides’s earliest extant tragedy, and one of\\nhis least- performed works.\\nI started reading it on the tube. Not exactly a page-turner. An odd play.\\nThe hero, Admetus, is condemned to death by the Fates. But thanks to\\nApollo’s negotiating, he is offered a loophole—Admetus can escape death\\nif he can persuade someone else to die for him. He asks his mother and\\nfather to die in his place, and they refuse in no uncertain terms. It’s hard to\\nknow what to make of Admetus. Not exactly heroic behavior, and the\\nancient Greeks must have thought him a bit of a twit. Alcestis is made of\\nstronger stuff—she steps forward and volunteers to die for her husband.\\nPerhaps she doesn’t expect Admetus to accept her offer—but he does, and\\nAlcestis dies and departs for Hades.\\nIt doesn’t end there, though. There is a happy ending, of sorts, a deus ex\\nmachina. Heracles seizes Alcestis from Hades and brings her triumphantly\\nback to the land of the living. She comes alive again. Admetus is moved to\\ntears by the reunion with his wife. Alcestis’s emotions are harder to read—\\nshe remains silent. She doesn’t speak.\\nI sat up with a jolt as I read this. I couldn’t believe it.\\nI read the final page of the play again slowly, carefully:\\nAlcestis returns from death, alive again. And she remains silent—unable\\nor unwilling to speak of her experience. Admetus appeals to Heracles in\\ndesperation:\\n“But why is my wife standing here, and does not speak?”\\nNo answer is forthcoming. The tragedy ends with Alcestis being led back\\ninto the house by Admetus—in silence.\\nWhy? Why does she not speak? CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\\nAlicia Berenson’s Diary\\nAUGUST 2\\nIt’s even hotter today. It’s hotter in London than in Athens, apparently. But\\nat least Athens has a beach.\\nPaul called me today from Cambridge. I was surprised to hear his voice.\\nWe’ve not spoken in months. My first thought was Auntie Lydia must be\\ndead—I’m not ashamed to say I felt a flicker of relief.\\nBut that’s not why Paul was calling. In fact I’m still not sure why he did call\\nme. He was pretty evasive. I kept waiting for him to get to the point, but he\\ndidn’t. He kept asking if I was okay, if Gabriel was okay, and muttered\\nsomething about Lydia being the same as always.\\n“I’ll come for a visit,” I said. “I haven’t been for ages, I’ve been meaning\\nto.”\\nThe truth is, I have many complicated feelings around going home, and\\nbeing at the house, with Lydia and Paul. So I avoid going back—and I end\\nup feeling guilty, so I can’t win either way.\\n“It would be nice to catch up,” I said. “I’ll come see you soon. I’m just\\nabout to go out, so—”\\nThen Paul spoke so quietly I couldn’t hear him.\\n“Sorry? Can you repeat that?”\\n“I said I’m in trouble, Alicia. I need your help.”\\n“What’s the matter?”\\n“I can’t talk about it on the phone. I need to see you.”\\n“It’s just—I’m not sure I can make it up to Cambridge at the minute.” “I’ll come to you. This afternoon. Okay?”\\nSomething in Paul’s voice made me agree without thinking about it. He\\nsounded desperate.\\n“Okay. Are you sure you can’t tell me about it now?”\\n“I’ll see you later.” Paul hung up.\\nI kept thinking about it for the rest of the morning. What could be serious\\nenough that Paul would turn to me, of all people? Was it about Lydia? Or\\nthe house, perhaps? It didn’t make sense.\\nI wasn’t able to get any work done after lunch. I blamed the heat, but in\\ntruth my mind was elsewhere. I hung around in the kitchen, glancing out the\\nwindows, until I saw Paul on the street.\\nHe waved at me. “Alicia, hi.”\\nThe first thing that struck me was how terrible he looked. He’d lost a lot of\\nweight, particularly around his face, the temples and jaw. He looked\\nskeletal, unwell. Exhausted. Scared.\\nWe sat in the kitchen with the portable fan on. I offered him a beer but he\\nsaid he’d rather have something stronger, which surprised me because I\\ndon’t remember him being much of a drinker. I poured him a whiskey—a\\nsmall one—and he topped it up when he thought I wasn’t looking.\\nHe didn’t say anything at first. We sat there in silence for a moment. Then\\nhe repeated what he had said on the phone. The same words:\\n“I’m in trouble.”\\nI asked him what he meant. Was it about the house?\\nPaul looked at me blankly. No, it wasn’t the house.\\n“Then what?”\\n“It’s me.” He hesitated, then came out with it. “I’ve been gambling. And\\nlosing a lot, I’m afraid.”\\nHe’d been gambling regularly for years. He said it started as a way of\\ngetting out of the house—somewhere to go, something to do, a bit of fun—\\nand I can’t say I blame him. Living with Lydia, fun must be in short supply.\\nBut he’s been losing more and more, and now it had gotten out of hand. He’s been dipping into the savings account. And not much was there to start\\nwith.\\n“How much do you need?”\\n“Twenty grand.”\\nI couldn’t believe my ears. “You lost twenty grand?”\\n“Not all at once. And I borrowed from some people—and now they want it\\nback.”\\n“What people?”\\n“If I don’t pay them back, I’m going to be in trouble.”\\n“Have you told your mother?” I already knew the answer. Paul may be a\\nmess but he’s not stupid.\\n“Of course not. Mum would kill me. I need your help, Alicia. That’s why I’m\\nhere.”\\n“I haven’t got that kind of money, Paul.”\\n“I’ll pay it back. I don’t need it all at once. Just something.”\\nI didn’t say anything and he kept pleading. They wanted something tonight.\\nHe didn’t dare go back empty-handed. Whatever I could give him, anything.\\nI didn’t know what to do. I wanted to help him, but I suspected giving him\\nmoney wasn’t the way to deal with this. I also knew his debts were going to\\nbe a tough secret to keep from Auntie Lydia. I didn’t know what I’d do if I\\nwere Paul. Facing up to Lydia was probably scarier than the loan sharks.\\n“I’ll write you a check,” I said finally.\\nPaul seemed pathetically grateful and kept muttering, “Thank you, thank\\nyou.”\\nI wrote him a check for two thousand pounds, payable to cash. I know that’s\\nnot what he wanted, but the whole thing was uncharted territory for me.\\nAnd I’m not sure I believed everything he said. Something about it didn’t\\nring true.\\n“Maybe I can give you more once I’ve talked to Gabriel,” I said. “But it’s\\nbetter if we work out another way to handle this. You know, Gabriel’s\\nbrother is a lawyer. Maybe he could—” Paul jumped up, terrified, shaking his head. “No, no, no. Don’t tell Gabriel.\\nDon’t involve him. Please. I’ll work out how to handle it. I’ll work it out.”\\n“What about Lydia? I think maybe you should—”\\nPaul shook his head fiercely and took the check. He looked disappointed at\\nthe amount but didn’t say anything. He left soon after afterward.\\nI have the feeling I let him down. It’s a feeling I’ve always had about Paul,\\nsince we were kids. I’ve always failed to live up to his expectations of me—\\nthat I should be a mothering figure to him. He should know me better than\\nthat. I’m not the mothering type.\\nI told Gabriel about it when he got back. He was annoyed with me. He said\\nI shouldn’t have given Paul any money, that I don’t owe him anything, he’s\\nnot my responsibility.\\nI know Gabriel is right, but I can’t help feeling guilty. I escaped from that\\nhouse, and from Lydia—Paul didn’t. He’s still trapped there. He’s still eight\\nyears old. I want to help him.\\nBut I don’t know how.\\nAUGUST 6\\nI spent all day painting, experimenting with the background of the Jesus\\npicture. I’ve been making sketches from the photos we took in Mexico—red,\\ncracked earth, dark, spiny shrubs—thinking about how to capture that heat,\\nthat intense dryness—and then I heard Jean-Felix calling my name.\\nI thought for a second about ignoring him, pretending I wasn’t there. But\\nthen I heard the clink of the gate, and it was too late. I stuck my head\\noutside and he was walking across the garden.\\nHe waved at me. “Hey, babes. Am I disturbing you? Are you working?”\\n“I am, actually.”\\n“Good, good. Keep at it. Only six weeks until the exhibition, you know.\\nYou’re horribly behind.” He laughed that annoying laugh of his. My\\nexpression must have given me away because he added quickly, “Only\\njoking. I’m not here to check up on you.” I didn’t say anything. I just went back into the studio, and he followed. He\\npulled up a chair in front of the fan. He lit a cigarette, and the smoke\\nwhirled about him in the breeze. I went back to the easel and picked up my\\nbrush. Jean-Felix talked as I worked. He complained about the heat, saying\\nLondon wasn’t designed to cope with this kind of weather. He compared it\\nunfavorably with Paris and other cities. I stopped listening after a while.\\nHe went on complaining, self-justifying, self-pitying, boring me to death. He\\nnever asks me anything. He doesn’t have any actual interest in me. Even\\nafter all these years, I’m just a means to an end—an audience of the Jean-\\nFelix Show.\\nMaybe that’s unkind. He’s an old friend—and he’s always been there for me.\\nHe’s lonely, that’s all. So am I. Well, I’d rather be lonely than be with the\\nwrong person. That’s why I never had any serious relationships before\\nGabriel. I was waiting for Gabriel, for someone real, as solid and true as\\nthe others were false. Jean-Felix was always jealous of our relationship. He\\ntried to hide it—and still does—but it’s obvious to me he hates Gabriel. He’s\\nalways bitching about him, implying Gabriel’s not as talented as I am, that\\nhe’s vain and egocentric. I think Jean-Felix believes that one day he will\\nwin me over to his side, and I’ll fall at his feet. But what he doesn’t realize\\nis that with every snide comment and bitchy remark, he drives me further\\ninto Gabriel’s arms.\\nJean-Felix is always alluding to our long, long friendship—it’s the hold he\\nhas on me—the intensity of those early years, when it was just “us against\\nthe world.” But I don’t think Jean-Felix realizes he’s holding on to a part of\\nmy life when I wasn’t happy. And any affection I have for Jean-Felix is for\\nthat time. We’re like a married couple who have fallen out of love. Today I\\nrealized just how much I dislike him.\\n“I’m working,” I said. “I need to get on with this, so if you don’t mind…”\\nJean-Felix pulled a face. “Are you asking me to leave? I’ve been watching\\nyou paint since you first picked up a brush. If I’ve been a distraction all\\nthese years, you might have said something sooner.”\\n“I’m saying something now.”\\nMy face was feeling hot and I was getting angry. I couldn’t control it. I tried\\nto paint but my hand was shaking. I could feel Jean-Felix watching me—I could practically hear his mind working—ticking, whirring, spinning. “I’ve\\nupset you,” he said at last. “Why?”\\n“I just told you. You can’t keep popping over like this. You need to text me\\nor call first.”\\n“I didn’t realize I needed a written invitation to see my best friend.”\\nThere was a pause. He’d taken it badly. I guess there was no other way to\\ntake it. I hadn’t planned on telling him like this—I’d intended to break it to\\nhim more gently. But somehow I was unable to stop myself. And the funny\\nthing is, I wanted to hurt him. I wanted to be brutal.\\n“Jean-Felix, listen.”\\n“I’m listening.”\\n“There’s no easy way to say this. But after the show, it’s time for a change.”\\n“Change of what?”\\n“Change of gallery. For me.”\\nJean-Felix looked at me, astonished. He looked like a little boy, I thought,\\nabout to burst into tears, and I found myself feeling nothing but irritation.\\n“It’s time for a fresh start. For both of us.”\\n“I see.” He lit another cigarette. “And I suppose this is Gabriel’s idea?”\\n“Gabriel’s got nothing to do with it.”\\n“He hates my guts.”\\n“Don’t be stupid.”\\n“He poisoned you against me. I’ve seen it happening. He’s been doing it for\\nyears.”\\n“That’s not true.”\\n“What other explanation is there? What other reason could you have for\\nstabbing me in the back?”\\n“Don’t be so dramatic. This is only about the gallery. It’s not about you and\\nme. We’ll still be friends. We can still hang out.”\\n“If I text or call first?” He laughed and started talking fast, as if he was\\ntrying to get it out before I could stop him. “Wow, wow, wow. All this time I really believed in something, you know, in you and me—and now you’ve\\ndecided it was nothing. Just like that. No one cares about you like I do, you\\nknow. No one.”\\n“Jean-Felix, please—”\\n“I can’t believe you just decided like that.”\\n“I’ve been wanting to tell you for a while.”\\nThis was clearly the wrong thing to say. Jean-Felix looked stunned. “What\\ndo you mean, a while? How long?”\\n“I don’t know. A while.”\\n“And you’ve been acting for me? Is that it? Christ, Alicia. Don’t end it like\\nthis. Don’t discard me like this.”\\n“I’m not discarding you. Don’t be so dramatic. We’ll always be friends.”\\n“Let’s just slow down here. You know why I came over? To ask you to the\\ntheater on Friday.” He pulled two tickets from inside his jacket and showed\\nthem to me—they were for a tragedy by Euripides, at the National. “I’d like\\nyou to come with me. It’s a more civilized way to say goodbye, don’t you\\nthink? For old times’ sake. Don’t say no.”\\nI hesitated. It was the last thing I wanted to do. But I didn’t want to upset\\nhim further. I think I would have agreed to anything—just to get him out of\\nthere. So I said yes.\\n10:30 P.M.\\nWhen Gabriel got home, I talked to him about what happened with Jean-\\nFelix. He said he never understood our friendship anyway. He said Jean-\\nFelix is creepy and doesn’t like the way he looks at me.\\n“And how is that?”\\n“Like he owns you or something. I think you should leave the gallery now—\\nbefore the show.”\\n“I can’t do that—it’s too late. I don’t want him to hate me. You don’t how\\nvindictive he can be.”\\n“It sounds like you’re afraid of him.” “I’m not. It’s just easier this way—to pull away gradually.”\\n“The sooner the better. He’s in love with you. You know that, don’t you?”\\nI didn’t argue—but Gabriel is wrong. Jean-Felix isn’t in love with me. He’s\\nmore attached to my paintings than he is to me. Which is another reason to\\nget away from him. Jean-Felix doesn’t care about me at all. Gabriel was\\nright about one thing, though.\\nI am afraid of him. CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\\nI FOUND DIOMEDES IN HIS OFFICE. He was sitting on a stool, in front of his\\nharp. It had a large and ornate wooden frame, with a shower of golden\\nstrings.\\n“That’s a beautiful object,” I said.\\nDiomedes nodded. “And very difficult to play.” He demonstrated,\\nsweeping his fingers lovingly along the strings. A cascading scale\\nresounded through the room. “Would you like to try?”\\nI smiled—and shook my head.\\nHe laughed. “I keep asking, you see, in the hope you will change your\\nmind. I’m nothing if not persistent.”\\n“I’m not very musical. I was told so in no uncertain terms by my music\\nteacher at school.”\\n“Like therapy, music is about a relationship, entirely dependent on the\\nteacher you choose.”\\n“No doubt that’s true.”\\nHe glanced out the window and nodded at the darkening sky. “Those\\nclouds, they have snow in them.”\\n“It looks like rain clouds to me.”\\n“No, it’s snow. Trust me, I come from a long line of Greek shepherds. It\\nwill be snowing tonight.”\\nDiomedes gave the clouds a last hopeful look, then turned back to me.\\n“What can I do for you, Theo?”\\n“It’s this.”\\nI slid the copy of the play across the desk. He peered at it.\\n“What is it?”\\n“A tragedy by Euripides.”\\n“I can see that. Why are you showing it to me?”\\n“Well, it’s the Alcestis—the title Alicia gave her self-portrait, painted\\nafter Gabriel’s murder.” “Oh, yes, yes, of course.” Diomedes looked at it with more interest.\\n“Casting herself as a tragic heroine.”\\n“Possibly. I must admit, I’m rather stumped. I thought you might have a\\nbetter handle on it than me.”\\n“Because I’m Greek?” He laughed. “You assume I will have an intimate\\nknowledge of every Greek tragedy?”\\n“Well, better than me, at any rate.”\\n“I don’t see why. It’s like assuming every Englishman is familiar with the\\nworks of Shakespeare.” He gave me a pitying smile. “Fortunately for you,\\nthat is the difference between our countries. Every Greek knows his\\ntragedies. The tragedies are our myths, our history—our blood.”\\n“Then you’ll be able to help me with this one.”\\nDiomedes picked it up and flicked through it. “And what is your\\ndifficulty?”\\n“My difficulty is the fact she doesn’t speak. Alcestis dies for her\\nhusband. And at the end, she comes back to life—but remains silent.”\\n“Ah. Like Alicia.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Again, I pose the question—what is your difficulty?”\\n“Well, obviously there’s a link—but I don’t understand it. Why doesn’t\\nAlcestis speak at the end?”\\n“Well, why do you think?”\\n“I don’t know. She’s overcome with emotion, possibly?”\\n“Possibly. What kind of emotion?”\\n“Joy?”\\n“Joy?” He laughed. “Theo, think. How would you feel? The person you\\nlove most in the world has condemned you to die, through their own\\ncowardice. That’s quite a betrayal.”\\n“You’re saying she was upset?”\\n“Have you never been betrayed?”\\nThe question cut through me like a knife. I felt my face go red. My lips\\nmoved but no sound came out.\\nDiomedes smiled. “I can see that you have. So … tell me. How does\\nAlcestis feel?”\\nI knew the answer this time. “Angry. She’s … angry.”\\n“Yes.” Diomedes nodded. “More than angry. She’s murderous—with\\nrage.” He chuckled. “One can’t help but wonder what their relationship will be like in the future, Alcestis and Admetus. Trust, once lost, is hard to\\nrecover.”\\nIt took a few seconds before I trusted myself to speak. “And Alicia?”\\n“What about her?”\\n“Alcestis was condemned to die by her husband’s cowardice. And Alicia\\n—”\\n“No, Alicia didn’t die … not physically.” He left the word hanging.\\n“Psychically, on the other hand…”\\n“You mean something happened—to kill her spirit … to kill her sense of\\nbeing alive?”\\n“Possibly.”\\nI felt dissatisfied. I picked up the play and looked at it. On the cover was\\na classical statue—a beautiful woman immortalized in marble. I stared at it,\\nthinking of what Jean-Felix had said to me. “If Alicia is dead … like\\nAlcestis, then we need to bring her back to life.”\\n“Correct.”\\n“It occurs to me that if Alicia’s art is her means of expression, how about\\nwe provide her with a voice?”\\n“And how do we do that?”\\n“How about we let her paint?”\\nDiomedes gave me a surprised look, followed by a dismissive wave of\\nhis hand. “She already has art therapy.”\\n“I’m not talking about art therapy. I’m talking about Alicia working on\\nher own terms—alone, with her own space to create. Let her express\\nherself, free up her emotions. It might work wonders.”\\nDiomedes didn’t reply for a moment. He mulled it over. “You’ll have to\\nsquare it with her art therapist. Have you come across her yet? Rowena\\nHart? She’s no pushover.”\\n“I’ll talk to her. But I have your blessing?”\\nDiomedes shrugged. “If you can persuade Rowena, go ahead. I can tell\\nyou now—she won’t like the idea. She won’t like it one bit.” CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\\n“I THINK IT’S A GREAT IDEA,” said Rowena.\\n“You do?” I tried not to look surprised. “Really?”\\n“Oh, yes. Only problem is, Alicia won’t go for it.”\\n“What makes you so sure?”\\nRowena gave a derisive snort. “Because Alicia’s the least responsive,\\nmost uncommunicative bitch I’ve ever worked with.”\\n“Ah.”\\nI followed Rowena into the art room. The floor was splashed with paint\\nlike an abstract mosaic, and the walls were covered with artwork—some of\\nit good, most just weird. Rowena had short blond hair, a deep-etched frown,\\nand a weary put-upon manner, doubtless due to her endless sea of\\nuncooperative patients. Alicia was clearly one such disappointment.\\n“She doesn’t participate in art therapy?” I said.\\n“She does not.” Rowena continued stacking artwork on a shelf as she\\nspoke. “I had high hopes when she joined the group—I did everything I\\ncould to make her feel welcome—but she just sits there, staring at the blank\\npage. Nothing will induce her to paint or even pick up a pencil and draw.\\nTerrible example to the others.”\\nI nodded sympathetically. The purpose of art therapy is to get the patients\\ndrawing and painting and, more important, talking about their artwork,\\nlinking it to their emotional state. It’s a great way to literally get their\\nunconscious onto the page, where it can be thought about and talked about.\\nAs always, it comes down to the individual skill of the therapist. Ruth used\\nto say that too few therapists were skilled or intuitive—most were just\\nplumbers. Rowena was, in my opinion, very much a plumber. She\\nobviously felt snubbed by Alicia. I tried to be as placating as possible.\\n“Perhaps it’s painful for her,” I suggested gently.\\n“Painful?” “Well, it can’t be easy for an artist of her ability to sit and paint with the\\nother patients.”\\n“Why not? Because she’s above it? I’ve seen her work. I don’t rate her\\nhighly at all.” Rowena sucked in her mouth as if she had tasted something\\nunpleasant.\\nSo that was why Rowena disliked Alicia—jealousy.\\n“Anyone can paint like that,” Rowena said. “It’s not difficult to represent\\nsomething photo-realistically—what’s harder is to have point of view about\\nit.”\\nI didn’t want to get into a debate about Alicia’s art. “So what you’re\\nsaying is you’ll be relieved if I take her off your hands?”\\nRowena shot me a sharp look. “You’re welcome to her.”\\n“Thank you. I’m grateful.”\\nRowena sniffed contemptuously. “You’ll need to supply the art materials.\\nMy budget doesn’t stretch to oils.” CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\\n“I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.”\\nAlicia didn’t look at me.\\nI went on, watching her carefully, “I happened to pass your old gallery\\nthe other day when I was in Soho. So I went inside. The manager was kind\\nenough to show me some of your work. He’s an old friend of yours? Jean-\\nFelix Martin?”\\nI waited for a response. None came.\\n“I hope you don’t think it was an invasion of your privacy. Perhaps I\\nshould have consulted you first. I hope you don’t mind.”\\nNo response.\\n“I saw a couple of paintings I’d not seen before. The one of your\\nmother … And the one of your aunt, Lydia Rose.”\\nAlicia slowly raised her head and looked at me. An expression was in her\\neyes I’d not seen before. I couldn’t quite place it. Was it … amusement?\\n“Quite apart from the obvious interest for me—as your therapist, I mean\\n—I found the paintings affecting on a personal level. They’re extremely\\npowerful pieces.”\\nAlicia eyes lowered. She was losing interest.\\nI persevered quickly. “A couple of things struck me. In the painting of\\nyour mother’s car accident, there’s something missing from the picture.\\nYou. You didn’t paint yourself in the car, even though you were there.”\\nNo reaction.\\n“I wondered if that means you’re only able to think of it as her tragedy?\\nBecause she died? But in fact there was also a little girl in that car. A girl\\nwhose feelings of loss were I suspect neither validated nor fully\\nexperienced.”\\nAlicia’s head moved. She glanced at me. It was a challenging look. I was\\nonto something. I kept going. “I asked Jean-Felix about your self-portrait, Alcestis. About its meaning.\\nAnd he suggested I have a look at this.”\\nI pulled out the copy of the play, Alcestis. I slid it across the coffee table.\\nAlicia glanced at it.\\n“‘Why does she not speak?’ That’s what Admetus asks. And I’m asking\\nyou the same question, Alicia. What is it that you can’t say? Why do you\\nhave to keep silent?”\\nAlicia closed her eyes—making me disappear. Conversation over. I\\nglanced at the clock on the wall behind her. The session was nearly\\nfinished. A couple of minutes remained.\\nI had been saving my trump card until now. And I played it, with a\\nfeeling of nervousness that I hoped wasn’t apparent.\\n“Jean-Felix made a suggestion. I thought it was rather a good one. He\\nthought you should be allowed to paint. Would you like that? We could\\nprovide you with a private space, with canvases and brushes and paints.”\\nAlicia blinked. Her eyes opened. It was as if a light had been switched on\\ninside them. They were the eyes of a child, wide and innocent, free of scorn\\nor suspicion. Color seemed to come into her face. Suddenly she seemed\\nwonderfully alive.\\n“I had a word with Professor Diomedes—he’s agreed to it, and so has\\nRowena.… So it’s up to you, really, Alicia. What do you think?”\\nI waited. She stared at me.\\nAnd then, finally, I got what I wanted—a definite reaction—a sign that\\ntold me I was on the right track.\\nIt was a small movement. Tiny, really. Nonetheless, it spoke volumes.\\nAlicia smiled. CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\\nTHE CANTEEN WAS THE WARMEST ROOM at the Grove. Piping-hot radiators\\nlined the walls, and the benches closest to them were always filled first.\\nLunch was the busiest meal, with staff and patients eating side by side. The\\nraised voices of the diners created a cacophony of noise, born from an\\nuncomfortable excitement when all the patients were in the same space.\\nA couple of jolly Caribbean dinner ladies laughed and chatted as they\\nserved up bangers and mash, fish-and-chips, chicken curry, all of which\\nsmelled better than they tasted. I selected fish-and-chips as the lesser of\\nthree evils. On my way to sit down, I passed Elif. She was surrounded by\\nher gang, a surly-looking crew of the toughest patients. She was\\ncomplaining about the food as I walked by her table.\\n“I’m not eating this shit.” She pushed away her tray.\\nThe patient to her right pulled the tray toward her, preparing to take it off\\nElif’s hands, but Elif whacked her across the head.\\n“Greedy bitch!” Elif shouted. “Give that back.”\\nThis prompted a guffaw of laughter around the table. Elif pulled back her\\nplate and tucked into her meal with renewed relish.\\nAlicia was sitting alone, I noticed, at the back of the room. She was\\npicking at a meager bit of fish like an anorexic bird, moving it around the\\nplate but not bringing it to her mouth. I was half tempted to sit with her but\\ndecided against it. Perhaps if she had looked up and made eye contact, I\\nwould have walked over. But she kept her gaze lowered, as if attempting to\\nblock out her surroundings and those around her. It felt like an invasion of\\nprivacy to intrude, so I sat at the end of another table, a few spaces away\\nfrom any patients, and started eating my fish-and-chips. I ate just a\\nmouthful of the soggy fish, which was tasteless, reheated but still cold in\\nthe center. I concurred with Elif’s appraisal. I was about to throw it in the\\nbin when someone sat down opposite me.\\nTo my surprise, it was Christian. “All right?” he said with a nod.\\n“Yeah, you?”\\nChristian didn’t reply. He hacked with determination through the rock-\\nsolid rice and curry. “I heard about your plan to get Alicia painting,” he said\\nbetween mouthfuls.\\n“I see news travels fast.”\\n“It does in this place. Your idea?”\\nI hesitated. “It was, yes. I think it’ll be good for her.”\\nChristian gave me a doubtful look. “Be careful, mate.”\\n“Thanks for the warning. But it’s rather unnecessary.”\\n“I’m just saying. Borderlines are seductive. That’s what’s going on here.\\nI don’t think you fully get that.”\\n“She’s not going to seduce me, Christian.”\\nHe laughed. “I think she already has. You’re giving her just what she\\nwants.”\\n“I’m giving her what she needs. There’s a difference.”\\n“How do you know what she needs? You’re overidentifying with her. It’s\\nobvious. She’s the patient, you know—not you.”\\nI looked at my watch in an attempt to disguise my anger. “I have to go.”\\nI stood and picked up my tray. I started walking away, but Christian\\ncalled after me, “She’ll turn on you, Theo. Just wait. Don’t say I didn’t\\nwarn you.”\\nI felt annoyed. And the annoyance stayed with me for the rest of the day.\\n*   *   *\\nAfter work, I left the Grove and went to the small shop at the end of the\\nroad, to buy a pack of cigarettes. I put a cigarette in my mouth, lit it, and\\ninhaled deeply, barely conscious of my actions. I was thinking about what\\nChristian had said, going over it in my mind while the cars sped past.\\nBorderlines are seductive, I heard him saying.\\nWas it true? Was that why I was so annoyed? Had Alicia emotionally\\nseduced me? Christian clearly thought so, and I had no doubt Diomedes\\nsuspected it. Were they right?\\nSearching my conscience, I felt confident the answer was no. I wanted to\\nhelp Alicia, yes—but I was also perfectly able to remain objective about\\nher, stay vigilant, tread carefully, and keep firm boundaries. I was wrong. It was already too late, though I wouldn’t admit this, even\\nto myself.\\n*   *   *\\nI called Jean-Felix at the gallery. I asked what had happened to Alicia’s art\\nmaterials—her paints, brushes, and canvases. “Is it all in storage?”\\nAfter a slight pause he answered, “Well, no, actually … I have all her\\nstuff.”\\n“You do?”\\n“Yes. I cleared out her studio after the trial—and got hold of everything\\nworth keeping—all her preliminary sketches, notebooks, her easel, her oils.\\nI’m storing it all for her.”\\n“How nice of you.”\\n“So you’re following my advice? Letting Alicia paint?”\\n“Yes. Whether anything will come of it remains to be seen.”\\n“Oh, something will come of it. You’ll see. All I ask is you let me have a\\nlook at the finished paintings.”\\nA strange note of hunger was in his voice. I had a sudden image of\\nAlicia’s pictures swaddled like babies in blankets in that storage room. Was\\nhe really keeping them safe for her? Or because he couldn’t bear to let go of\\nthem?\\n“Would you mind dropping off the materials to the Grove?” I said.\\n“Would that be convenient?”\\n“Oh, I—” There was a moment’s hesitation. I felt his anxiety.\\nI found myself coming to his rescue. “Or I can pick them up from you if\\nthat’s easier?”\\n“Yes, yes, perhaps that would be better.”\\nJean-Felix was scared of coming here, scared of seeing Alicia. Why?\\nWhat was there between them?\\nWhat was it that he didn’t want to face? CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\\n“WHAT TIME ARE YOU MEETING YOUR FRIEND?” I asked.\\n“Seven o’clock. After rehearsal.” Kathy handed me her coffee cup. “If\\nyou can’t remember her name, Theo, it’s Nicole.”\\n“Right.” I yawned.\\nKathy gave me a stern look. “You know, it’s a little insulting that you\\ndon’t remember—she’s one of my best friends. You went to her going-away\\nparty for fuck’s sake.”\\n“Of course I remember Nicole. I just forgot her name, that’s all.”\\nKathy rolled her eyes. “Whatever. Pothead. I’m having a shower.” She\\nwalked out of the kitchen.\\nI smiled to myself.\\nSeven o’clock.\\n*   *   *\\nAt a quarter to seven I walked along the river toward Kathy’s rehearsal\\nspace on the South Bank.\\nI sat on a bench across the way from the rehearsal room, facing away\\nfrom the entrance so Kathy wouldn’t immediately see me if she left early.\\nEvery so often I turned my head and glanced over my shoulder. But the\\ndoor remained obstinately shut.\\nThen, at five minutes past seven, it opened. There was the sound of\\nanimated conversation and laughter as the actors left the building. They\\nwandered out in groups of two or three. No sign of Kathy.\\nI waited five minutes. Ten minutes. The trickle of people stopped, and no\\none else came out. I must have missed her. She must have left before I\\narrived. Unless she hadn’t been here at all?\\nHad she been lying about the rehearsal?\\nI got up and made my way toward the entrance. I needed to be sure. If\\nshe was still inside and she saw me, what then? What excuse could I have for being here? I’d come to surprise her? Yes—I’d say I was here to take\\nher and “Nicole” out for dinner. Kathy would squirm and lie her way out of\\nit with some bullshit excuse—“Nicole is sick, Nicole has canceled”—so\\nKathy and I would end up spending an uncomfortable evening alone\\ntogether. Another evening of long silences.\\nI reached the entrance. I hesitated, grabbed the rusted green handle, and\\npushed open the door. I went inside.\\nThe bare concrete interior smelled damp. Kathy’s rehearsal space was on\\nthe fourth floor—she had moaned about having to climb the stairs every\\nday—so I went up the main central staircase. I reached the first floor and\\nwas starting for the second when I heard a voice on the stairs, coming from\\nthe floor above. It was Kathy. She was on the phone:\\n“I know, I’m sorry. I’ll see you soon. I won’t be long.… Okay, okay,\\nbye.”\\nI froze—we were seconds away from colliding with each other. I dashed\\ndown the steps, hiding around the corner. Kathy walked past without seeing\\nme. She went out the door. It slammed shut.\\nI hurried after her and left the building. Kathy was walking away, moving\\nfast, toward the bridge. I followed, weaving between commuters and\\ntourists, trying to keep a distance without losing sight of her.\\nShe crossed the bridge and went down the steps into the Embankment\\ntube station. I went after her, wondering which line she would take.\\nBut she didn’t get on the tube. Instead she walked straight through the\\nstation and out the other side. She continued walking toward Charing Cross\\nRoad. I followed. I stood a few steps behind her at the traffic lights. We\\ncrossed Charing Cross Road and headed into Soho. I followed her along the\\nnarrow streets. She took a right turn, a left, another right. Then she abruptly\\nstopped. She stood on the corner of Lexington Street. And waited.\\nSo this was the meeting place. A good spot—central, busy, anonymous. I\\nhesitated and slipped into a pub on the corner. I positioned myself at the bar.\\nIt offered a clear view through the window of Kathy across the road. The\\nbarman, bored, with an unruly beard, glanced at me. “Yeah?”\\n“A pint. Guinness.”\\nHe yawned and went to the other side of the bar to pour the pint. I kept\\nmy eyes on Kathy. I was pretty sure she wouldn’t be able to see me through\\nthe window even if she looked in this direction. At one point Kathy did look over—straight at me. My heart stopped for a second—I was sure she had\\nnoticed me—but no, her gaze drifted on.\\nThe minutes passed, and still Kathy waited. So did I. I sipped my pint\\nslowly, watching. He was taking his time, whoever he was. She wouldn’t\\nlike that. Kathy didn’t like to be kept waiting—even though she was\\nperpetually late. I could see she was getting annoyed, frowning and\\nchecking her watch.\\nA man crossed the road toward her. In the few seconds he took to cross\\nthe street, I had already assessed him. He was well built. He had shoulder-\\nlength fair hair, which surprised me, as Kathy always said she only went for\\nmen with dark hair and eyes like mine—unless that was another lie.\\nBut the man walked right by her. She didn’t even look at him. Soon he\\nwas out of sight. So it wasn’t him. I wondered if Kathy and I were both\\nthinking the same thing—had she been stood up?\\nThen her eyes widened. She smiled. She waved across the street—at\\nsomeone out of sight. At last, I thought. It’s him. I craned my neck to see—\\nTo my surprise, a tarty-looking blonde, about thirty, wearing an\\nimpossibly short skirt and improbably high heels, tottered over to Kathy. I\\nrecognized her at once. Nicole. They greeted each other with hugs and\\nkisses. They walked off, talking and laughing, arm in arm. So Kathy hadn’t\\nbeen lying about meeting Nicole.\\nI registered my emotions with shock—I ought to have been hugely\\nrelieved that Kathy had been telling the truth. I ought to have been grateful.\\nBut I wasn’t.\\nI was disappointed. CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\\n“WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK, ALICIA? Lots of light, eh? Do you like it?”\\nYuri showed off the new studio proudly. It had been his idea to\\ncommandeer the unused room next to the goldfish bowl, and I agreed—it\\nseemed a better idea than sharing Rowena’s art-therapy room, which, given\\nher obvious hostility, would have created difficulties. Now Alicia could\\nhave a room of her own, where she’d be free to paint whenever she wished\\nand without interruption.\\nAlicia looked around. Her easel had been unpacked and set up by the\\nwindow, where there was the most light. Her box of oils was open on a\\ntable. Yuri winked at me as Alicia approached the table. He was\\nenthusiastic about this painting scheme, and I was grateful for his support—\\nYuri was a useful ally, as he was by far the most popular member of the\\nstaff; with the patients, anyway. He gave me a nod, saying, “Good luck,\\nyou’re on your own now.” Then he left. The door closed after him with a\\nbang. But Alicia didn’t seem to hear it.\\nShe was in her own world, bent over the table, examining her paints with\\na small smile. She picked up the sable brushes and stroked them as if they\\nwere delicate flowers. She unpacked three tubes of oils—Prussian blue,\\nIndian yellow, cadmium red—and lined them up. She turned to the blank\\ncanvas on the easel. She considered it. She stood there for a long time. She\\nseemed to enter a trance, a reverie—her mind was elsewhere, having\\nescaped somehow, traveled far beyond this cell—until finally she came out\\nof it and turned back to the table. She squeezed some white paint onto the\\npalette and combined it with a small amount of red. She had to mix the\\npaints with a paintbrush: her palette knives had immediately been\\nconfiscated upon their arrival at the Grove by Stephanie, for obvious\\nreasons.\\nAlicia lifted the brush to the canvas—and made a mark. A single red\\nstroke of paint in the middle of the white space. She considered it for a moment. Then made another mark. Another. Soon\\nshe was painting without pause or hesitation, with total fluidity of\\nmovement. It was a kind of dance between Alicia and the canvas. I stood\\nthere, watching the shapes she was creating.\\nI remained silent, scarcely daring to breathe. I felt as if I was present at\\nan intimate moment, watching a wild animal give birth. Although Alicia\\nwas aware of my presence, she didn’t seem to mind. She occasionally\\nlooked up, while painting, and glanced at me.\\nAlmost as if she was studying me.\\n*   *   *\\nOver the next few days the painting slowly took shape, roughly at first,\\nsketchily, but with increasing clarity—then it emerged from the canvas with\\na burst of pristine photo-realistic brilliance.\\nAlicia had painted a redbrick building, a hospital—unmistakably the\\nGrove. It was on fire, burning to the ground. Two figures were discernible\\non the fire escape. A man and a woman escaping the fire. The woman was\\nunmistakably Alicia, her red hair the same color as the flames. I recognized\\nthe man as myself. I was carrying Alicia in my arms, holding her aloft\\nwhile the fire licked at my ankles.\\nI couldn’t tell if I was depicted as rescuing Alicia—or about to throw her\\nin the flames. CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\\n“THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I’ve been coming here for years and nobody ever told\\nme to call ahead before. I can’t stand around waiting all day. I’m an\\nextremely busy person.”\\nAn American woman was standing by the reception desk, complaining\\nloudly to Stephanie Clarke. I recognized Barbie Hellmann from the\\nnewspapers and TV coverage of the murder. She was Alicia’s neighbor in\\nHampstead, who heard the gunshots the night of Gabriel’s murder and\\nphoned the police.\\nBarbie was a Californian blonde in her mid-sixties, possibly older. She\\nwas drenched in Chanel No. 5, and she’d had considerable plastic surgery.\\nHer name suited her—she looked a like a startled Barbie doll. She was\\nobviously used to getting what she wanted—hence her loud protestations at\\nthe reception desk when she discovered she needed to make an appointment\\nto visit a patient.\\n“Let me talk to the manager,” she said with a grand gesture, as if this\\nwere a restaurant, instead of a psychiatric unit. “This is absurd. Where is\\nhe?”\\n“I am the manager, Mrs. Hellmann,” said Stephanie. “We’ve met before.”\\nThis was the first time I’d felt even vaguely sympathetic to Stephanie; it\\nwas hard not to pity her for being on the receiving end of Barbie’s\\nonslaught. Barbie talked a lot and talked fast, leaving no pauses, giving her\\nopponent no time to respond.\\n“Well, you never mentioned anything about making appointments\\nbefore.” Barbie laughed loudly. “For Christ’s sake, it’s easier to get a table\\nat the Ivy.”\\nI joined them and smiled at Stephanie innocently. “Can I help?”\\nStephanie shot me an irritated look. “No, thanks. I can manage.”\\nBarbie looked me up and down with some interest. “Who are you?”\\n“I’m Theo Faber. Alicia’s therapist.” “Oh, really?” Barbie said. “How interesting.” Therapists were obviously\\nsomething she could relate to, unlike ward managers. From then on, she\\ndeferred solely to me, treating Stephanie as if she were nothing more than a\\nreceptionist, which I must admit rather wickedly amused me.\\n“You must be new, if we’ve not met?” I opened my mouth to reply, but\\nBarbie got there first. “I usually come every couple of months or so. I left it\\na bit longer this time, as I’ve been in the States seeing my family, but as\\nsoon as I got back, I thought I must visit my Alicia—I miss her so much.\\nAlicia was my best friend, you know.”\\n“No, I didn’t know.”\\n“Oh, yeah. When they moved in next door, I was a great help in getting\\nAlicia and Gabriel settled into the neighborhood. Alicia and I became\\nextremely close. We’d confide in each other about everything.”\\n“I see.”\\nYuri appeared in the reception, and I beckoned him over.\\n“Mrs. Hellmann is here to see Alicia,” I said.\\n“Call me Barbie, honey. Yuri and I are old friends.” She winked at Yuri.\\n“We go way back. He’s not the problem. It’s this lady here—”\\nBarbie gestured dismissively at Stephanie, who finally found an\\nopportunity to speak. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Hellmann, but hospital policy has\\nchanged since you were here last year. We’ve tightened our security. From\\nnow on you’ll have to call before—”\\n“Oh God, do we have to go through this again? I’ll scream if I have to\\nhear it one more time. As if life weren’t complicated enough.”\\nStephanie gave up, and Yuri led off Barbie. I followed.\\nWe entered the visitors’ room and waited for Alicia. The bare room had a\\ntable and two chairs, no windows, and a sickly yellow fluorescent light. I\\nstood at the back and watched Alicia appear at the other door, accompanied\\nby two nurses. Alicia didn’t betray any obvious reaction to seeing Barbie.\\nShe walked over to the table and sat down without looking up.\\nBarbie seemed much more emotional. “Alicia, darling, I’ve missed you.\\nYou’re so thin, there’s nothing left of you. I’m so jealous. How are you?\\nThat awful woman nearly didn’t let me see you. It’s been a nightmare—”\\nSo it went, an endless stream of inane chatter from Barbie, details of her\\ntrip to San Diego to visit her mother and brother. Alicia just sat there, silent,\\nher face a mask, betraying nothing, showing nothing. After about twenty minutes, the monologue mercifully ended. Alicia was led away by Yuri, as\\nuninterested as she was when she had entered.\\nI approached Barbie as she was leaving the Grove. “Can I have a word?”\\nBarbie nodded, as if she had been expecting this. “You want to talk to me\\nabout Alicia? It’s about time somebody asked me some goddamn questions.\\nThe police didn’t want to hear anything—which was crazy, because Alicia\\nconfided in me all the time, you know? About everything. She told me\\nthings you wouldn’t believe.” Barbie said this with a definite emphasis and\\ngave me a coy smile. She knew she had piqued my interest.\\n“Such as?”\\nBarbie smiled cryptically and pulled on her fur coat. “Well, I can’t go\\ninto it here. I’m late enough as it is. Come over this evening—say six\\np.m.?”\\nI didn’t relish the prospect of visiting Barbie at her house—I sincerely\\nhoped Diomedes wouldn’t find out. But I had no choice—I wanted to find\\nout what she knew. I forced a smile. “What’s your address?” CHAPTER THIRTY\\nBARBIE’S HOUSE WAS ONE OF SEVERAL ACROSS the road from Hampstead\\nHeath, overlooking one of the ponds. It was large and, given its location,\\nprobably fantastically overpriced.\\nBarbie had lived in Hampstead for several years before Gabriel and\\nAlicia moved in next door. Her ex-husband was an investment banker and\\nhad commuted between London and New York until they divorced. He\\nfound himself a younger, blonder version of his wife—and Barbie got the\\nhouse. “So everyone was happy,” she said with a laugh. “Particularly me.”\\nBarbie’s house was painted pale blue, in contrast to the other houses on\\nthe street, which were white. Her front garden was decorated with little\\ntrees and potted plants.\\nBarbie greeted me at the door. “Hi, honey. I’m glad you’re on time.\\nThat’s a good sign. This way.”\\nShe led me through the hallway to the living room, talking the entire\\ntime. I only partially listened and took in my surroundings. The house\\nsmelled like a greenhouse; it was full of plants and flowers—roses, lilies,\\norchids, everywhere you looked. Paintings, mirrors, and framed\\nphotographs were crammed together on the walls; little statues, vases, and\\nother objets d’art competed for space on tables and dressers. All expensive\\nitems, but crammed together like this, they looked like junk. Taken as a\\nrepresentation of Barbie’s mind, it suggested a disordered inner world, to\\nsay the least. It made me think of chaos, clutter, greed—insatiable hunger. I\\nwondered what her childhood had been like.\\nI shifted a couple of tasseled cushions to make room and sat on the\\nuncomfortable large sofa. Barbie opened a drinks cabinet and pulled out a\\ncouple of glasses.\\n“Now, what do you want to drink? You look like a whiskey drinker to\\nme. My ex-husband drank a gallon of whiskey a day. He said he needed it to put up with me.” She laughed. “I’m a wine connoisseur, actually. I went\\non a course in the Bordeaux region in France. I have an excellent nose.”\\nShe paused for breath and I took the opportunity to speak while I had the\\nchance. “I don’t like whiskey. I’m not much of a drinker … just the odd\\nbeer, really.”\\n“Oh.” Barbie looked rather annoyed. “I don’t have any beer.”\\n“Well, that’s fine, I don’t need a drink—”\\n“Well, I do, honey. It’s been one of those days.”\\nBarbie poured herself a large glass of red wine and curled up in the\\narmchair as if she were settling in for a good chat. “I’m all yours.” She\\nsmiled flirtatiously. “What do you want to know?”\\n“I have couple of questions, if that’s all right.”\\n“Well, fire away.”\\n“Did Alicia ever mention seeing a doctor?”\\n“A doctor?” Barbie seemed surprised by the question. “You mean a\\nshrink?”\\n“No, I mean a medical doctor.”\\n“Oh, well, I don’t…” Barbie hesitated. “Actually, now that you mention\\nit, yes, there was someone she was seeing.…”\\n“Do you know the name?”\\n“No, I don’t—but I remember I told her about my doctor, Dr. Monks,\\nwho’s just incredible. He only has to look at you to see what’s wrong with\\nyou straightaway, and he tells you exactly what to eat. It’s amazing.” A long\\nand complicated explanation of the dietary demands by Barbie’s doctor\\nfollowed, and an insistence I pay him a visit soon. I was starting to lose\\npatience. It took some effort to get her back on track.\\n“You saw Alicia on the day of the murder?”\\n“Yes, just a few hours before it happened.” Barbie paused to gulp some\\nmore wine. “I went over to see her. I used to pop over all the time, for\\ncoffee—well, she drank coffee, I usually took a bottle of something. We’d\\ntalk for hours. We were so close, you know.”\\nSo you keep saying, I thought. But I had already diagnosed Barbie as\\nalmost entirely narcissistic; I doubted she was able to relate to others except\\nas a function of her own needs. I imagined Alicia didn’t do much talking\\nduring these visits.\\n“How would you describe her mental state that afternoon?” Barbie shrugged. “She seemed fine. She had a bad headache, that was\\nall.”\\n“She wasn’t on edge at all?”\\n“Should she be?”\\n“Well, given the circumstances…”\\nBarbie gave me an astonished look. “You don’t think she was guilty, do\\nyou?” She laughed. “Oh, honey—I thought you were smarter than that.”\\n“I’m afraid I don’t—”\\n“Alicia was no way tough enough to kill anyone. She wasn’t a killer.\\nTake it from me. She’s innocent. I’m a hundred percent sure.”\\n“I’m curious how you can be so positive, given the evidence—”\\n“I don’t give a shit about that. I’ve got my own evidence.”\\n“You do?”\\n“You bet. But first … I need to know if I can trust you.” Barbie’s eyes\\nsearched mine hungrily.\\nI met her gaze steadily.\\nThen she came out with it, just like that: “You see, there was a man.”\\n“A man?”\\n“Yes. Watching.”\\nI was a little taken aback and immediately alert. “What do you mean,\\nwatching?”\\n“Just what I said. Watching. I told the police, but they didn’t seem\\ninterested. They made up their minds the moment they found Alicia with\\nGabriel’s body and the gun. They didn’t want to listen to any other story.”\\n“What story—exactly?”\\n“I’ll tell you. And you’ll see why I wanted you to come over tonight. It’s\\nworth hearing.”\\nJust get on with it, I thought. But I said nothing and smiled\\nencouragingly.\\nShe refilled her glass. “It started a couple of weeks before the murder. I\\nwent over to see Alicia, and we had a drink, and I noticed she was quieter\\nthan usual—I said, ‘Are you okay?’ And she started crying. I’d never seen\\nher like that before. She was crying her eyes out. She was normally so\\nreserved, you know … but that day she just let go. She was a mess, honey, a\\nreal mess.”\\n“What did she say?” “She asked me if I’d noticed anyone hanging around in the\\nneighborhood. She’d seen a man on the street, watching her.” Barbie\\nhesitated. “I’ll show you. She texted this to me.”\\nBarbie’s manicured hands stretched for her phone, and she searched\\nthrough her photos on it. She thrust the phone at my face.\\nI stared at it. It took me a second to make sense of what I was seeing. A\\nblurred photograph of a tree.\\n“What is it?”\\n“What does it look like?”\\n“A tree?”\\n“Behind the tree.”\\nBehind the tree was a gray blob—it could have been anything from a\\nlamppost to a large dog.\\n“It’s a man. You can see his outline quite distinctly.”\\nI wasn’t convinced but didn’t argue. I didn’t want Barbie to get\\ndistracted. “Keep going.”\\n“That’s it.”\\n“But what happened?”\\nBarbie shrugged. “Nothing. I told Alicia to tell the cops—and that was\\nwhen I found out she hadn’t even told her husband about it.”\\n“She hadn’t told Gabriel? Why not?”\\n“I don’t know. I got the feeling he wasn’t all that sympathetic a person.\\nAnyway. I insisted she tell the police. I mean, what about me? What about\\nmy safety? A prowler’s outside—and I’m a woman living alone, you know?\\nI want to feel safe when I go to bed at night.”\\n“Did Alicia follow your advice?”\\nBarbie shook her head. “No, she did not. A few days later, she told me\\nshe’d talked it over with her husband and decided she was imagining it all.\\nShe told me to forget it—and asked me not to mention it to Gabriel if I saw\\nhim. I don’t know, the whole thing stank to me. And she asked me to delete\\nthe photo. I didn’t—I showed it to the police when she was arrested. But\\nthey weren’t interested. They’d already made up their minds. But I’m\\npositive there’s more to it. Can I tell you…?” She lowered her voice to a\\ndramatic whisper. “Alicia was scared.”\\nBarbie left a dramatic pause, finishing her wine. She reached for the\\nbottle. “Sure you don’t want a drink?” I refused again, thanked her, made my excuses, and left. There was no\\npoint in staying further; she had nothing else to tell me. I had more than\\nenough to think about.\\nIt was dark when I left her house. I paused a moment outside the house\\nnext door—Alicia’s old house. It had been sold soon after the trial, and a\\nJapanese couple lived there. They were—according to Barbie—most\\nunfriendly. She had made several advances, which they had resisted. I\\nwondered how I’d feel if Barbie lived next door to me, endlessly popping\\nover. I wondered how Alicia felt about her.\\nI lit a cigarette and thought about what I had just heard. So Alicia told\\nBarbie she was being watched. The police had presumably thought Barbie\\nwas attention-seeking and making it up, which was why they had ignored\\nher story. I wasn’t surprised; Barbie was hard to take seriously.\\nIt meant that Alicia had been scared enough to appeal to Barbie for help\\n—and afterward to Gabriel. What then? Did Alicia confide in someone\\nelse? I needed to know.\\nI had a sudden image of myself as a child. A little boy close to bursting\\nwith anxiety, holding in all my terrors, all my pain; pacing endlessly,\\nrestless, scared; alone with the fears of my crazy father. No one to tell. No\\none who’d listen. Alicia must have felt similarly desperate, or she’d never\\nhave confided in Barbie.\\nI shivered—and sensed a pair of eyes on the back of my head.\\nI spun around—but no one was there. I was alone. The street was empty,\\nshadowy, and silent. CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\\nI ARRIVED AT THE GROVE THE NEXT MORNING, intending to talk to Alicia about\\nwhat Barbie had told me. But as soon as I entered reception, I heard a\\nwoman screaming. Howls of agony echoing along the corridors.\\n“What is it? What’s going on?”\\nThe security guard ignored my questions. He ran past me into the ward. I\\nfollowed him. The screams grew louder as I approached. I hoped Alicia was\\nokay, that she wasn’t involved—but somehow I had a bad feeling.\\nI turned the corner. A crowd of nurses, patients, and security staff were\\ngathered outside the goldfish bowl. Diomedes was on the phone, calling for\\nparamedics. His shirt was spattered with blood—but not his blood. Two\\nnurses were kneeling on the floor, assisting a screaming woman. The\\nwoman was not Alicia.\\nIt was Elif.\\nElif was writhing, screaming in agony, clutching at her bloody face. Her\\neye was gushing blood. Something stuck out of her eye socket, plunged into\\nthe eyeball. It looked like a stick. But it wasn’t a stick. I knew at once what\\nit was. It was a paintbrush.\\nAlicia was standing by the wall, being restrained by Yuri and another\\nnurse. But no physical restraint was necessary. She was totally calm,\\nperfectly still, like a statue. Her expression reminded me sharply of the\\npainting—the Alcestis. Blank, expressionless. Empty. She stared straight at\\nme.\\nFor the first time, I felt afraid. CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\\n“HOW IS ELIF?” I was waiting in the goldfish bowl and caught Yuri once he\\nreturned from the emergency ward.\\n“Stable.” He sighed heavily. “Which is about the best we can hope for.”\\n“I’d like to see her.”\\n“Elif? Or Alicia?”\\n“Elif first.”\\nYuri nodded. “They want her to rest tonight, but in the morning I’ll take\\nyou to her.”\\n“What happened? Were you there? I presume Alicia was provoked?”\\nYuri sighed again and shrugged. “I don’t know. Elif was hanging around\\noutside Alicia’s studio. There must have been a confrontation of some kind.\\nI’ve no idea what they were fighting about.”\\n“Have you got the key? Let’s go and have a look. See if we can find any\\nclues.”\\nWe left the goldfish bowl and walked to Alicia’s studio. Yuri unlocked\\nthe door and opened it. He flicked on the light.\\nAnd there, on the easel, was the answer we were looking for.\\nAlicia’s painting—the picture of the Grove going up in flames—had been\\ndefaced. The word SLUT was crudely daubed across it in red paint.\\nI nodded. “Well, that explains it.”\\n“You think Elif did it?”\\n“Who else?”\\n*   *   *\\nI found Elif in the emergency ward. She was propped up in bed, attached to\\na drip. Padded bandages were wrapped around her head, covering one eye.\\nShe was upset, angry, and in pain.\\n“Fuck off,” she said when she saw me. I pulled up a chair by the bed and sat down. I spoke gently, respectfully.\\n“I’m sorry, Elif. Truly sorry. This is an awful thing to happen. A tragedy.”\\n“Too fucking right. Now, piss off and leave me alone.”\\n“Tell me what happened.”\\n“That bitch took out my fucking eye. That’s what happened.”\\n“Why did she do that? Did you have a fight?”\\n“You trying to blame me? I didn’t do nothing!”\\n“I’m not trying to blame you. I just want to understand why she did it.”\\n“’Cause she’s got a fucking screw loose, that’s why.”\\n“It had nothing to do with the painting? I saw what you did. You defaced\\nit, didn’t you?”\\nElif narrowed her remaining eye, then firmly closed it.\\n“That was a bad thing to do, Elif. It doesn’t justify her response, but still\\n—”\\n“That ain’t why she did it.” Elif opened her eye and stared at me\\nscornfully.\\nI hesitated. “No? Then why did she attack you?”\\nElif’s lips twisted into a kind of smile. She didn’t speak. We sat like that\\nfor a few moments. I was about to give up, then she spoke.\\n“I told her the truth.”\\n“What truth?”\\n“That you’re soft on her.”\\nI was startled by this.\\nBefore I could respond, Elif went on, speaking with cold contempt.\\n“You’re in love with her, mate. I told her so. ‘He loves you,’ I said. ‘He\\nloves you—Theo and Alicia sitting in a tree. Theo and Alicia K I S S I N G\\n—’” Elif started laughing, a horrible shrieking laugh. I could picture the rest\\n—Alicia goaded into a frenzy, spinning round, raising her paintbrush … and\\nplunging it into Elif’s eye.\\n“She’s a fucking nutter.” Elif sounded close to tears, anguished,\\nexhausted. “She’s a psycho.”\\nLooking at Elif’s bandaged wound, I couldn’t help but wonder if she was\\nright. CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\\nTHE MEETING TOOK PLACE in Diomedes’s office, but Stephanie Clarke\\nassumed control from the start. Now that we had left the abstract world of\\npsychology and entered the concrete realm of health and safety, we were\\nunder her jurisdiction and she knew it. Judging by Diomedes’s sullen\\nsilence, it was obvious so did he.\\nStephanie was standing with her arms crossed; her excitement was\\npalpable. She’s getting off on this, I thought—being in charge, and having\\nthe last word. How she must have resented us all, overruling her, teaming\\nup against her. Now she was relishing her revenge. “The incident yesterday\\nmorning was totally unacceptable,” she said. “I warned against Alicia being\\nallowed to paint, but I was overruled. Individual privileges always stir up\\njealousies and resentments. I knew something like this would happen. From\\nnow on, safety must come first.”\\n“Is that why Alicia has been put in seclusion?” I said. “In the interest of\\nsafety?”\\n“She is a threat to herself, and others. She attacked Elif—she could have\\nkilled her.”\\n“She was provoked.”\\nDiomedes shook his head and spoke wearily. “I don’t think any level of\\nprovocation justifies that kind of attack.”\\nStephanie nodded. “Precisely.”\\n“It was an isolated incident,” I said. “Putting Alicia in seclusion isn’t just\\ncruel—it’s barbaric.” I had seen patients subjected to seclusion in\\nBroadmoor, locked in a tiny, windowless room, barely enough space for a\\nbed, let alone other furniture. Hours or days in seclusion was enough to\\ndrive anyone mad, let alone someone who was already unstable.\\nStephanie shrugged. “As manager of the clinic, I have the authority to\\ntake any action I deem necessary. I asked Christian for his guidance, and he\\nagreed with me.” “I bet he did.”\\nAcross the room, Christian smiled smugly at me. I could also feel\\nDiomedes watching me. I knew what they were thinking—I was letting it\\nget personal, and letting my feelings show; but I didn’t care.\\n“Locking her up is not the answer. We need to keep talking to her. We\\nneed to understand.”\\n“I understand perfectly,” Christian said with a heavy, patronizing tone, as\\nif he were talking to a backward child. “It’s you, Theo.”\\n“Me?”\\n“Who else? You’re the one who’s been stirring things up.”\\n“In what sense, stirring?”\\n“It’s true, isn’t it? You campaigned to lower her medication—”\\nI laughed. “It was hardly a campaign. It was an intervention. She was\\ndrugged up to the eyeballs. A zombie.”\\n“Bullshit.”\\nI turned to Diomedes. “You’re not seriously trying to pin this on me? Is\\nthat what’s happening here?”\\nDiomedes shook his head but evaded my eye. “Of course not.\\nNonetheless, it’s obvious that her therapy has destabilized her. It’s\\nchallenged her too much, too soon. I suspect that’s why this unfortunate\\nevent took place.”\\n“I don’t accept that.”\\n“You’re possibly too close to see it clearly.” Diomedes threw up his\\nhands and sighed, a man defeated. “We can’t afford any more mistakes, not\\nat such a critical juncture—as you know, the future of the unit is at stake.\\nEvery mistake we make gives the Trust another excuse to close us down.”\\nI felt intensely irritated at his defeatism, his weary acceptance. “The\\nanswer is not to drug her up and throw away the key. We’re not jailers.”\\n“I agree.” Indira gave me a supportive smile and went on, “The problem\\nis we’ve become so risk averse, we’d rather overmedicate than take any\\nchances. We need to be brave enough to sit with the madness, to hold it—\\ninstead of trying to lock it up.”\\nChristian rolled his eyes and was about to object, but Diomedes spoke\\nfirst, shaking his head. “It’s too late for that. This is my fault. Alicia isn’t a\\nsuitable candidate for psychotherapy. I should never have allowed it.”\\nDiomedes said he blamed himself, but I knew he was really blaming me.\\nAll eyes were on me: Diomedes’s disappointed frown; Christian’s gaze, mocking, triumphant; Stephanie’s hostile stare; Indira’s look of concern.\\nI tried not to sound as if I was pleading. “Stop Alicia painting if you\\nmust. But don’t stop her therapy—it’s the only way to reach her.”\\nDiomedes shook his head. “I’m beginning to suspect she’s unreachable.”\\n“Just give me some more time—”\\n“No.” The note of finality in Diomedes’s voice told me that arguing\\nfurther was pointless. It was over. CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\\nDIOMEDES WAS WRONG ABOUT IT SNOWING. It didn’t snow; instead it started\\nraining heavily that afternoon. A storm with angry drumbeats of thunder\\nand lightning flashes.\\nI waited for Alicia in the therapy room, watching the rain batter the\\nwindow.\\nI felt weary and depressed. The whole thing had been a waste of time. I\\nhad lost Alicia before I could help her; now I never would.\\nA knock at the door. Yuri escorted Alicia into the therapy room. She\\nlooked worse than I expected. She was pale, ashen, ghostlike. She moved\\nclumsily, and her right leg trembled nonstop. Fucking Christian, I thought—\\nshe was drugged out of her mind.\\nThere was a long pause after Yuri left. Alicia didn’t look at me.\\nEventually I spoke. Loudly and clearly, to make sure she understood.\\n“Alicia. I’m sorry you were put in seclusion. I’m sorry you had to go\\nthrough that.”\\nNo reaction.\\nI hesitated. “I’m afraid that because of what you did to Elif, our therapy\\nhas been terminated. This wasn’t my decision—far from it—but there’s\\nnothing I can do about it. I’d like to offer you this opportunity to talk about\\nwhat happened, to explain your attack on Elif. And express the remorse I’m\\nsure you’re feeling.”\\nAlicia said nothing. I wasn’t sure my words were penetrating her\\nmedicated haze.\\n“I’ll tell you how I feel. I feel angry, to be honest. I feel angry that our\\nwork is ending before we’ve even properly begun—and I feel angry that\\nyou didn’t try harder.”\\nAlicia’s head moved. Her eyes stared into mine.\\n“You’re afraid, I know that. I’ve been trying to help you—but you won’t\\nlet me. And now I don’t know what to do.” I fell silent, defeated.\\nThen Alicia did something I will never forget.\\nShe held out her trembling hand toward me. She was clutching\\nsomething—a small leatherbound notebook.\\n“What’s that?”\\nNo reply. She kept holding it out.\\nI peered at it, curious. “Do you want me to take it?”\\nNo response. I hesitated and gently took the notebook from her fluttering\\nfingers. I opened it and thumbed through the pages. It was a handwritten\\ndiary, a journal.\\nAlicia’s journal.\\nJudging by the handwriting, it was written in a chaotic state of mind,\\nparticularly the last pages, where the writing was barely legible—arrows\\nconnecting different paragraphs written in different angles across the page,\\ndoodles and drawings taking over some pages, flowers growing into vines,\\ncovering what had been written and making it almost indecipherable.\\nI looked at Alicia, burning with curiosity. “What do you want me to do\\nwith this?”\\nThe question was quite unnecessary. It was obvious what Alicia wanted.\\nShe wanted me to read it. PART THREE\\nI mustn’t put strangeness where there’s nothing. I think that is the danger of keeping a\\ndiary: you exaggerate everything, you are on the lookout, and you continually stretch\\nthe truth.\\n—JEAN-PAUL SARTRE\\nThough I am not naturally honest, I am sometimes so by chance.\\n—WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, The Winter’s Tale Alicia Berenson’s Diary\\nAUGUST 8\\nSomething odd happened today.\\nI was in the kitchen, making coffee, looking out the window—looking\\nwithout seeing—daydreaming—and then I noticed something, or rather\\nsomeone—outside. A man. I noticed him because he was standing so still—\\nlike a statue—and facing the house. He was on the other side of the road, by\\nthe entrance to the park. He was standing in the shadow of a tree. He was\\ntall, well built. I couldn’t make out his features, as he was wearing\\nsunglasses and a cap.\\nI couldn’t tell if he could see me or not, through the window, but it felt as if\\nhe was staring right at me. I thought it was weird—I’m used to people\\nwaiting across the street at the bus stop, but he wasn’t waiting for a bus. He\\nwas staring at the house.\\nI realized that I had been standing there for several minutes, so I made\\nmyself leave the window. I went to the studio. I tried to paint but couldn’t\\nconcentrate. My mind kept going back to the man. I decided to give myself\\nanother twenty minutes, then I’d go back to the kitchen and look. If he was\\nstill there, then what? He wasn’t doing anything wrong. He might be a\\nburglar, studying the house—I suppose that was my first thought—but why\\njust stand there like that, so conspicuously? Maybe he was thinking of\\nmoving here? Maybe he’s buying the house for sale at the end of the street?\\nThat could explain it.\\nBut when I went back to the kitchen and peered out of the window, he had\\ngone. The street was empty.\\nI guess I’ll never know what he was doing. How strange. AUGUST 10\\nI went to the play with Jean-Felix last night. Gabriel didn’t want me to, but\\nI went anyway. I was dreading it, but I thought if I gave Jean-Felix what he\\nwanted and went with him, maybe that would be an end to this. I hoped so,\\nanyway.\\nWe arranged to meet early, to have a drink—his idea—and when I got there,\\nit was still light. The sun was low in the sky, coloring the river bloodred.\\nJean-Felix was waiting for me outside the National. I saw him before he\\nsaw me. He was scanning the crowds, scowling. If I had any doubt I was\\ndoing the right thing, seeing his angry face dispelled it. I was filled with a\\nhorrible kind of dread—and nearly turned and bolted. But he turned and\\nsaw me before I could. He waved, and I went over to him. I pretended to\\nsmile, and so did he.\\n“I’m so glad you came,” Jean-Felix said. “I was worried you wouldn’t\\nshow up. Shall we go in and have a drink?”\\nWe had a drink in the foyer. It was awkward, to say the least. Neither of us\\nmentioned the other day. We talked a lot about nothing, or rather Jean-\\nFelix talked and I listened. We ended up having a couple of drinks. I hadn’t\\neaten and I felt a bit drunk; I think that was probably Jean-Felix’s intention.\\nHe was trying his best to engage me, but the conversation was stilted—it\\nwas orchestrated, stage-managed. Everything that came out of his mouth\\nseemed to start with “Wasn’t it fun when” or “Do you remember that time\\nwe”—as if he’d rehearsed little reminiscences in the hope that they’d\\nweaken my resolve and remind me how much history we had, how close we\\nwere. What he doesn’t seem to realize is I’ve made my decision. And\\nnothing he can say now will change that.\\nIn the end, I’m glad I went. Not because I saw Jean-Felix—because I saw\\nthe play. Alcestis isn’t a tragedy I’ve heard of—I suppose it’s obscure\\nbecause it’s a smaller kind of domestic story, which is why I liked it so\\nmuch. It was staged in the present day, in a small suburban house in\\nAthens. I liked the scale of it. An intimate kitchen-sink tragedy. A man is\\ncondemned to die, and his wife, Alcestis, wants to save him. The actress\\nplaying Alcestis looked like a Greek statue, she had a wonderful face—I\\nkept thinking about painting her. I thought about getting her details and\\ncontacting her agent. I nearly mentioned it to Jean-Felix, but I stopped myself. I don’t want to involve him in my life anymore, on any level. I had\\ntears in my eyes at the end—Alcestis dies and is reborn. She literally comes\\nback from the dead. There’s something there that I need to think about. I’m\\nnot sure exactly what yet. Of course, Jean-Felix had all kinds of reactions to\\nthe play, but none of them resonated with me, so I tuned him out and\\nstopped listening.\\nI couldn’t get Alcestis’s death and resurrection out of my mind—I kept\\nthinking about it as we walked back across the bridge to the station. Jean-\\nFelix asked if I wanted to have another drink, but I said I was tired. There\\nwas another awkward pause. We stood outside the entrance to the station. I\\nthanked him for the evening and said it had been fun.\\n“Just have one more drink,” Jean-Felix said. “One more. For old times’\\nsake?”\\n“No, I should go.”\\nI tried to leave—and he grabbed my hand.\\n“Alicia,” he said. “Listen to me. I need to tell you something.”\\n“No, please don’t, there’s nothing to say, really—”\\n“Just listen. It’s not what you think.”\\nAnd he was right, it wasn’t. I was expecting Jean-Felix to plead for our\\nfriendship, or try to make me feel guilty for leaving the gallery. But what he\\nsaid took me totally by surprise.\\n“You need to be careful,” he said. “You’re way too trusting. The people\\naround you … you trust them. Don’t. Don’t trust them.”\\nI stared at him blankly. It took me a second to speak.\\n“What are you talking about? Who do you mean?”\\nJean-Felix just shook his head and didn’t say anything. He let go of my\\nhand and walked off. I called after him but he didn’t stop.\\n“Jean-Felix. Stop.”\\nHe didn’t look back. I watched him disappear around the corner. I stood\\nthere, rooted to the spot. I didn’t know what to think. What was he doing\\nmaking a mysterious warning and then walking off like that? I guess he wanted to get the upper hand and leave me feeling unsure and wrong-\\nfooted. And he succeeded.\\nHe also left me feeling angry. Now, in a way, he’s made it easy for me. Now\\nI’m determined to cut him out of my life. What did he mean about “people\\naround me”—presumably that means Gabriel? But why?\\nNo. I’m not doing this. This is exactly what Jean-Felix wanted—to fuck with\\nmy head. Get me obsessing about him. Come between me and Gabriel.\\nI won’t fall for it. I won’t give it another thought.\\nI went back home, and Gabriel was in bed, asleep. He had a five a.m. call\\nfor a shoot. But I woke him up, and we had sex. I couldn’t get close enough\\nto him or feel him deeply enough in me. I wanted to be fused with him. I\\nwanted to climb inside him and disappear.\\nAUGUST 11\\nI saw that man again. He was a bit farther away this time—he was sitting\\non a bench farther into the park. But it was him, I could tell—most people\\nare wearing shorts and T-shirts and light colors in this weather, and he was\\nwearing a dark shirt and trousers, black sunglasses, and cap. His head was\\nangled toward the house, looking at it.\\nI had a funny thought—maybe he’s not a burglar, perhaps he’s a painter.\\nPerhaps he’s a painter like me and he’s thinking about painting the street—\\nor the house. But as soon as I thought this, I knew it wasn’t true. If he were\\nreally going to paint the house, he wouldn’t just be sitting there—he’d be\\nmaking sketches.\\nI got myself into a state about it and I phoned Gabriel. That was a mistake.\\nI could tell he was busy—the last he needed was me calling, freaking out\\nbecause I think someone is watching the house.\\nOf course, I’m only assuming the man is watching the house.\\nHe could be watching me.\\nAUGUST 13 He was there again.\\nIt was soon after Gabriel left this morning. I had a shower and saw him out\\nthe bathroom window. He was closer this time. He was standing outside the\\nbus stop. Like he was casually waiting for the bus.\\nI don’t know who he thinks he’s fooling.\\nI got dressed quickly and went into the kitchen to have a better look. But he\\nwas gone.\\nI decided to tell Gabriel about it when he got home. I thought he’d brush it\\noff, but he took it seriously. He seemed quite worried.\\n“Is it Jean-Felix?” he said straightaway.\\n“No, of course not. How can you even think that?”\\nI tried to sound surprised and indignant. But in truth I had wondered that\\ntoo. The man and Jean-Felix are the same build. It could be Jean-Felix, but\\neven so—I just don’t want to believe it. He wouldn’t try and frighten me like\\nthat. Would he?\\n“What’s Jean-Felix’s number?” Gabriel said. “I’m calling him right now.”\\n“Darling, don’t, please. I’m sure it’s not him.”\\n“Positive?”\\n“Absolutely. Nothing happened. I don’t know why I’m making such a big\\ndeal out of it. It’s nothing.”\\n“How long was he there for?”\\n“Not long—an hour or so—and then he vanished.”\\n“What do you mean, vanished?”\\n“He just disappeared.”\\n“Uh-huh. Is there any chance you could be imagining this?”\\nSomething about the way he said that annoyed me. “I’m not imagining it. I\\nneed you to believe me.”\\n“I do believe you.”\\nBut I could tell he didn’t totally believe me. He only partly believed me.\\nPart of him was just humoring me. Which makes me angry, if I’m honest. So angry I have to stop here—or I might write something I’ll regret.\\nAUGUST 14\\nI jumped out of bed as soon as I woke up. I checked the window, hoping the\\nman would be there again—so Gabriel could see him too—but there was no\\nsign of him. So I felt even more stupid.\\nThis afternoon I decided to go for a walk, despite the heat. I wanted to be in\\nthe park, away from the buildings and roads and other people—and be\\nalone with my thoughts. I walked up to Parliament Hill, passing the bodies\\nof sunbathers strewn around on either side of the path. I found a bench that\\nwas unoccupied, and I sat down. I stared out at London glinting in the\\ndistance.\\nWhile I was there, I was conscious the whole time of something. I kept\\nlooking over my shoulder—but couldn’t see anyone. But someone was there,\\nthe whole time. I could feel it. I was being watched.\\nOn my way back, I walked past the pond. I happened to look up—and there\\nhe was, the man. He was standing across the water on the other side, too\\nfar away to see clearly, but it was him. I knew it was him. He was standing\\nperfectly still, motionless, staring right at me.\\nI felt an icy shiver of fear. I acted out of instinct:\\n“Jean-Felix?” I shouted. “Is that you? Stop it. Stop following me!”\\nHe didn’t move. I acted as fast as I could. I reached into my pocket, pulled\\nout my phone, and took a photo of him. What good it will do, I have no idea.\\nThen I turned and started walking quickly to the end of the pond, not letting\\nmyself look back until I reached the main path. I was scared he was going\\nto be right behind me.\\nI turned around—and he was gone.\\nI hope it’s not Jean-Felix. I really do.\\nWhen I got home, I was feeling on edge. I drew the blinds and turned off the\\nlights. I peered out the window—and there he was:\\nThe man was standing on the street, staring up at me. I froze—I didn’t know\\nwhat to do. I nearly jumped out of my skin when someone called my name:\\n“Alicia? Alicia, are you there?”\\nIt was that awful woman from next door. Barbie Hellmann. I left the window\\nand went to the back door and opened it. Barbie had let herself in the side\\ngate and was in the garden, clutching a bottle of wine.\\n“Hi, honey. I saw you weren’t in your studio. I wondered where you were.”\\n“I was out, I just got back.”\\n“Time for a drink?” She said this in a baby voice she sometimes uses and\\nthat I find irritating.\\n“Actually, I should get back to work.”\\n“Just a quick one. And then I have to go. I’ve got my Italian class tonight.\\nOkay?”\\nWithout waiting for a reply, she came in. She said something about how\\ndark it was in the kitchen and started opening the blinds without asking me.\\nI was about to stop her, but when I looked outside, no one was on the street.\\nThe man had gone.\\nI don’t know why I told Barbie about it. I don’t like her or trust her—but I\\nwas scared, I suppose, and I needed someone to talk to, and she happened\\nto be there. We had a drink, which was unlike me, and I burst into tears.\\nBarbie stared at me wide-eyed, silent for once. After I finished, she put\\ndown her bottle of wine and said, “This calls for something stronger.” She\\npoured us a couple of whiskeys.\\n“Here.” She gave it to me. “You need this.”\\nShe was right—I needed it. I knocked it back and felt a kick from it. Now it\\nwas my turn to listen, while Barbie talked. She didn’t want to scare me, she\\nsaid, but it didn’t sound good. “I’ve seen this on like a million TV shows.\\nHe’s studying your house, okay? Before he makes his move.”\\n“You think he’s a burglar?”\\nBarbie shrugged. “Or a rapist. Does that matter? It’s bad news, whatever it\\nis.”\\nI laughed. I felt relieved and grateful that someone was taking me seriously\\n—even if it was just Barbie. I showed her the photo on my phone, but she wasn’t impressed.\\n“Text it to me so I can look at it with my glasses on. It looks like a blurry\\nsmudge to me. Tell me. Have you mentioned this to your husband yet?”\\nI decided to lie. “No. Not yet.”\\nBarbie gave me a funny look. “Why not?”\\n“I don’t know, I suppose I worry Gabriel might think I’m exaggerating—or\\nimagining it.”\\n“Are you imagining it?”\\n“No.”\\nBarbie looked pleased. “If Gabriel doesn’t take you seriously, we’ll go to\\nthe police together. You and me. I can be very persuasive, believe me.”\\n“Thanks, but I’m sure that won’t be necessary.”\\n“It’s already necessary. Take this seriously, honey. Promise me you’ll tell\\nGabriel when he gets home?”\\nI nodded. But I had already decided not to say anything further to Gabriel.\\nThere was nothing to tell. I have no proof the man was following me or\\nwatching me. Barbie was right, the photo proves nothing.\\nIt was all in my imagination—that’s what Gabriel will say. Best not to say\\nanything to him at all and risk upsetting him again. I don’t want to bother\\nhim.\\nI’m going to forget all about it.\\n4:00 A.M.\\nIt’s been a bad night.\\nGabriel came home, exhausted, at about ten. He’d had a long day and\\nwanted to go to bed early. I tried to sleep too, but I couldn’t.\\nThen a couple of hours ago, I heard a noise. It was coming from the garden.\\nI got up and went to the back window. I looked out—I couldn’t see anyone,\\nbut I felt someone’s eyes on me. Someone was watching me from the\\nshadows. I managed to pull myself away from the window and ran to the bedroom. I\\nshook Gabriel awake.\\n“The man is outside,” I said, “he’s outside the house.”\\nGabriel didn’t know what I was talking about. When he understood, he\\nstarted to get angry. “For Christ’s sake. Give it a rest. I’ve got to be at work\\nin three hours. I don’t want to play this fucking game.”\\n“It’s not a game. Come and look. Please.”\\nSo we went to the window—\\nAnd of course, the man wasn’t there. There was no one there.\\nI wanted Gabriel to go outside, to check, but he wouldn’t. He went back\\nupstairs, annoyed. I tried reasoning with him, but he said he wasn’t talking\\nto me and went to sleep in the spare room.\\nI didn’t go back to bed. I’ve been sitting here since then, waiting, listening,\\nalert to any sound, checking the windows. No sign of him so far.\\nOnly a couple more hours to go. It will be light soon.\\nAUGUST 15\\nGabriel came downstairs ready to go to the shoot. When he saw me by the\\nwindow and realized I’d been up all night, he went quiet and started acting\\nstrange.\\n“Alicia, sit down. We need to talk.”\\n“Yes. We do need to talk. About the fact that you don’t believe me.”\\n“I believe that you believe it.”\\n“That’s not the same thing. I’m not a fucking idiot.”\\n“I never said you were an idiot.”\\n“Then what are you saying?”\\nI thought we were about to get into a fight, so I was taken aback by what\\nGabriel said. He spoke in a whisper. I could barely hear him. He said:\\n“I want you to talk to someone. Please.”\\n“What do you mean? A policeman?” “No,” Gabriel said, looking angry again. “Not a policeman.”\\nI understood what he meant, what he was saying. But I needed to hear him\\nsay it. I wanted him to spell it out. “Then who?”\\n“A doctor.”\\n“I’m not seeing a doctor, Gabriel—”\\n“I need you to do this for me. You need to meet me halfway.” He said it\\nagain: “I need you to meet me halfway.”\\n“I don’t understand what you mean. Halfway where? I’m right here.”\\n“No, you’re not. You’re not here!”\\nHe looked so tired, so upset. I wanted to protect him. I wanted to comfort\\nhim. “It’s okay, darling,” I said. “It’s going to be okay, you’ll see.”\\nGabriel shook his head, like he didn’t believe me. “I’m going to make an\\nappointment with Dr. West. As soon as he can see you. Today if possible.”\\nHe hesitated and looked at me. “Okay?”\\nGabriel held out his hand for mine—I wanted to slap it away or scratch it. I\\nwanted to bite him or hit him, or throw over the table and scream, “You\\nthink I’m fucking crazy but I’m not crazy! I’m not, I’m not, I’m not!”\\nBut I didn’t do any of those things. Instead I nodded and took Gabriel’s\\nhand, and held it.\\n“Okay, darling,” I said. “Whatever you want.”\\nAUGUST 16\\nI went to see Dr. West today. Unwillingly, but I went.\\nI hate him, I’ve decided. I hate him and his narrow house, and sitting in that\\nweird, small room upstairs, hearing his dog barking in the living room. It\\nnever stopped barking, the whole time I was there. I wanted to shout at it to\\nshut up, and I kept thinking Dr. West would say something about it, but he\\nacted like he couldn’t hear it. Maybe he couldn’t. He didn’t seem to hear\\nanything I was saying either. I told him what happened. I told him about the\\nman watching the house, and how I had seen him following me into the\\npark. I said all of this, but he didn’t respond. He just sat there with that thin smile of his. He looked at me like I was an insect or something. I know he’s\\nsupposedly a friend of Gabriel’s, but I don’t see how they ever could have\\nbeen friends. Gabriel is so warm, and Dr. West is the opposite of warm. It’s\\na strange thing to say about a doctor, but he has no kindness.\\nAfter I finished telling him about the man, he didn’t speak for ages. The\\nsilence seemed to last forever. The only sound was that dog downstairs. I\\nstarted to mentally tune in to the barking and go into a kind of trance. It\\ntook me by surprise when Dr. West actually spoke.\\n“We’ve been here before, Alicia, haven’t we?”\\nI looked at him blankly. I wasn’t sure what he meant. “Have we?”\\nHe nodded. “Yes. We have.”\\n“I know you think I’m imagining this. I’m not imagining it. It’s real.”\\n“That’s what you said last time. Remember last time? Do you remember\\nwhat happened?”\\nI didn’t reply. I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction. I just sat there,\\nglaring at him, like a disobedient child.\\nDr. West didn’t wait for an answer. He kept talking, reminding me what\\nhappened after my father died, about the breakdown I suffered, the\\nparanoid accusations that I made—the belief I was being watched, being\\nfollowed, and spied upon. “So, you see, we’ve been here before, haven’t\\nwe?”\\n“But that was different. It was just a feeling. I never actually saw someone.\\nThis time I saw someone.”\\n“And who did you see?”\\n“I already told you. A man.”\\n“Describe him to me.”\\nI hesitated. “I can’t.”\\n“Why not?”\\n“I couldn’t see him clearly. I told you—he was too far away.”\\n“I see.”\\n“And—he was in disguise. He was wearing a cap. And sunglasses.” “A lot of people are wearing sunglasses in this weather. And hats. Are they\\nall in disguise?”\\nI was starting to lose my temper. “I know what you’re trying to do.”\\n“And what is that?”\\n“You’re trying to get me to admit I’m going crazy again—like after Dad\\ndied.”\\n“Is that what you think is happening?”\\n“No. That time I was sick. This time I’m not sick. Nothing’s the matter with\\nme—apart from the fact that someone is spying on me and you won’t believe\\nme!”\\nDr. West nodded, but didn’t say anything. He wrote a couple of things down\\nin his notebook.\\n“I’m going to put you back on medication. As a precaution. We don’t want\\nto let this get out hand, do we?”\\nI shook my head. “I’m not taking any pills.”\\n“I see. Well, if you refuse the medication, it’s important to be aware of the\\nconsequences.”\\n“What consequences? Are you threatening me?”\\n“It’s nothing to do with me. I’m talking about your husband. How do you\\nthink Gabriel feels about what he went through, last time you were\\nunwell?”\\nI pictured Gabriel downstairs, waiting in the living room with the barking\\ndog. “I don’t know. Why don’t you ask him?”\\n“Do you want him to have to go through it all again? Do you perhaps think\\nthere’s a limit to how much he can take?”\\n“What are you saying? I’ll lose Gabriel? That’s what you think?”\\nEven saying it made me feel sick. The thought of losing him, I couldn’t bear\\nit. I’d do anything to keep him—even pretend I’m crazy when I know I’m\\nnot. So I gave in. I agreed to be “honest’ with Dr. West about what I was\\nthinking and feeling and tell him if I heard any voices. I promised to take\\nthe pills he gave me, and to come back in two weeks, for a checkup. Dr. West looked pleased. He said we could go downstairs now and rejoin\\nGabriel. As he went downstairs in front of me, I thought about reaching\\nforward and shoving him down the stairs. I wish I had.\\nGabriel seemed much happier on the way home. He kept glancing at me as\\nhe was driving and smiling. “Well done. I’m proud of you. We’re going to\\nget through this, you’ll see.”\\nI nodded but didn’t say anything. Because of course it’s bullshit—“we”\\naren’t going to get through this.\\nI’m going to have to deal with it alone.\\nIt was a mistake telling anyone. Tomorrow I’m going to tell Barbie to forget\\nall about it—I’ll say I’ve put it behind me and I don’t want to talk about it\\nagain. She’ll think I’m odd and she’ll be annoyed because I’ll be denying\\nher the drama, but if I act normally, she’ll soon forget all about it. As for\\nGabriel, I’m going to put his mind at rest. I’m going to act like everything is\\nback to normal. I’ll give a brilliant performance. I won’t let my guard slip\\nfor a second.\\nWe went to the pharmacy on the way back, and Gabriel got my prescription.\\nOnce we were home again, we went into the kitchen.\\nHe gave me the yellow pills with a glass of water. “Take them.”\\n“I’m not a child. You don’t need to hand them to me.”\\n“I know you’re not a child. I just want to make sure you’ll take them—and\\nnot throw them away.”\\n“I’ll take them.”\\n“Go on, then.”\\nGabriel watched me put the pills in my mouth and sip some water.\\n“Good girl,” he said, and kissed my cheek. He left the room.\\nThe moment Gabriel’s back was turned, I spat out the pills. I spat them into\\nthe sink and washed them down the drain. I’m not taking any medication.\\nThe drugs Dr. West gave me last time nearly drove me crazy. And I’m not\\ngoing to risk that again.\\nI need my wits about me now.\\nI need to be prepared. AUGUST 17\\nI’ve started hiding this diary. There’s a loose floorboard in the spare\\nbedroom. I’m keeping it there, out of sight in the space underneath the\\nfloorboards. Why? Well, I’m being too honest here in these pages. It’s not\\nsafe to leave it lying around. I keep imagining Gabriel stumbling across the\\nnotebook and fighting his curiosity but then opening it and starting to read.\\nIf he found out I’m not taking the medication, he’d feel so betrayed, so hurt\\n—I couldn’t bear that.\\nThank God I have this diary to write in. It’s keeping me sane. There’s no one\\nelse I can talk to.\\nNo one I can trust.\\nAUGUST 21\\nI’ve not been outside for three days. I’ve been pretending to Gabriel that\\nI’m going for walks in the afternoons when he’s out, but it’s not true.\\nIt makes me fearful, the thought of going outside. I’ll be too exposed. At\\nleast here, in the house, I know I’m safe. I can sit by the window and\\nmonitor the passersby. I’m scanning each face that passes for that man’s\\nface—but I don’t know what he looks like, that’s the problem. He could have\\nremoved his disguise and be moving about in front of me, completely\\nunnoticed.\\nThat’s an alarming thought.\\nAUGUST 22\\nStill no sign of him. But I mustn’t lose focus. It’s just a matter of time.\\nSooner or later he’ll be back. I need to be ready. I need to take steps.\\nI woke up this morning and remembered Gabriel’s gun. I’m going to move it\\nfrom the spare room. I’ll keep it downstairs where I can get to it easily. I’ll\\nput it in the kitchen cupboard, by the window. That way it will be there if I\\nneed it. I know all this sounds crazy. I hope nothing comes of it. I hope I never see\\nthe man again.\\nBut I have a horrible feeling I will.\\nWhere is he? Why hasn’t he been here? Is he trying to get me to lower my\\nguard? I mustn’t do that. I must continue my vigil by the window.\\nKeep waiting.\\nKeep watching.\\nAUGUST 23\\nI’m starting to think I imagined the whole thing. Maybe I did.\\nGabriel keeps asking me how I’m doing—if I’m okay. I can tell he’s\\nworried, despite me insisting I’m fine. My acting doesn’t seem to be\\nconvincing him anymore. I need to try harder. I pretend to be focused on\\nwork all day, whereas in fact work couldn’t be further from my mind. I’ve\\nlost any connection with it, any impetus to finish the paintings. As I write\\nthis, I can’t honestly say I think I’ll paint again. Not until all this is behind\\nme, anyway.\\nI’ve been making excuses about why I don’t want to go out, but Gabriel told\\nme tonight I had no choice. Max has asked us out to dinner.\\nI can’t think of anything worse than seeing Max. I pleaded with Gabriel to\\ncancel, saying I needed to work, but he told me it would do me good to go.\\nHe insisted and I could tell he meant it, so I had no choice. I gave in and\\nsaid yes.\\nI’ve been worrying all day, about tonight. Because as soon as my mind\\nstarted turning on it, everything seemed to fall into place. Everything made\\nsense. I don’t know why I didn’t think of it before, it’s so obvious.\\nI understand now. The man—the man who’s watching—it isn’t Jean-Felix.\\nJean-Felix isn’t dark or devious enough to do this kind of thing. Who else\\nwould want to torment me, scare me, punish me?\\nMax.\\nOf course it’s Max. It has to be Max. He’s trying to drive me crazy. I’m dreading it, but I must work up the courage somehow. I’m going to do it\\ntonight.\\nI’m going to confront him.\\nAUGUST 24\\nIt felt strange and a little frightening to go out last night, after so long\\ninside the house.\\nThe outside world felt huge—an empty space around me, the big sky above.\\nI felt very small and held on to Gabriel’s arm for support.\\nEven though we went to our old favorite, Augusto’s, I didn’t feel safe. It\\ndidn’t feel comforting or familiar like it used to. The restaurant seemed\\ndifferent somehow. And it smelled different—it smelled of something\\nburning. I asked Gabriel if something was on fire in the kitchen, but he said\\nhe couldn’t smell anything, that I was imagining it.\\n“Everything’s fine,” he said. “Just calm down.”\\n“I am calm. Don’t I seem calm?”\\nGabriel didn’t respond. He just clenched his jaw, the way he does when he’s\\nannoyed. We sat down and waited for Max in silence.\\nMax brought his receptionist to dinner. Tanya, she’s called. Apparently\\nthey’ve started dating. Max was acting like he was smitten with her, his\\nhands all over her, touching her, kissing her—and all the time he kept\\nstaring at me. Did he think he was going to make me jealous? He’s horrible.\\nHe makes me sick.\\nTanya noticed something was up—she caught Max staring at me a couple of\\ntimes. I should warn her about him really. Tell her what she’s getting into.\\nMaybe I will, but not right now. I’ve got other priorities at the moment.\\nMax said he was going to the bathroom. I waited a moment and I then\\nseized my chance. I said I needed the bathroom too. I left the table and\\nfollowed him.\\nI caught up with Max around the corner and grabbed hold of his arm. I\\ngripped it hard.\\n“Stop it,” I said. “Stop it!” Max looked bemused. “Stop what?”\\n“You’re spying on me, Max. You’re watching me. I know you are.”\\n“What? I have no idea what you are talking about, Alicia.”\\n“Don’t lie to me.” I was finding it hard to control my voice. I wanted to\\nscream. “I’ve seen you, okay? I took a photo. I took a picture of you!”\\nMax laughed. “What are you talking about? Let go of me, you crazy bitch.”\\nI slapped his face. Hard.\\nAnd then I turned and saw Tanya standing there. She looked like she was\\nthe one who’d been slapped.\\nTanya looked from Max to me but didn’t say anything. She walked out of the\\nrestaurant.\\nMax glared at me, and before he followed her, he hissed, “I have no idea\\nwhat you’re talking about. I’m not fucking watching you. Now, get out of my\\nway.”\\nThe way he said it, with such anger, such contempt, I could tell Max was\\nspeaking the truth. I believed him. I didn’t want to believe him—but I did.\\nBut if it’s not Max … who is it?\\nAUGUST 25\\nI just heard something. A noise outside. I checked the window. And I saw\\nsomeone, moving in the shadows—\\nIt’s the man. He’s outside.\\nI phoned Gabriel but he didn’t pick up. Should I call the police? I don’t\\nknow what to do. My hand is shaking so much I can barely—\\nI can hear him—downstairs—he’s trying the windows, and the doors. He’s\\ntrying to get in.\\nI need to get out of here. I need to escape.\\nOh my God—I can hear him—\\nHe’s inside.\\nHe’s inside the house. PART FOUR\\nThe aim of therapy is not to correct the past, but to enable the patient to confront his\\nown history, and to grieve over it.\\n—ALICE MILLER CHAPTER ONE\\nI CLOSED ALICIA’S DIARY and placed it on my desk.\\nI sat there, not moving, listening to the rain pelting outside the window. I\\ntried to make sense of what I had just read. There was obviously a great\\ndeal more to Alicia Berenson than I had supposed. She had been like a\\nclosed book to me; now that book was open and its contents had taken me\\naltogether by surprise.\\nI had a lot of questions. Alicia suspected she was being watched. Did she\\never discover the man’s identity? Did she tell anyone? I needed to find out.\\nAs far as I knew, she only confided in three people—Gabriel, Barbie, and\\nthis mysterious Dr. West. Did she stop there, or did she tell anyone else?\\nAnother question. Why did the diary end so abruptly? Was there more,\\nwritten elsewhere? Another notebook, which she didn’t give to me? And I\\nwondered about Alicia’s purpose in giving me the journal to read. She was\\ncommunicating something, certainly—and it was a communication of\\nalmost shocking intimacy. Was it a gesture of good faith—showing how\\nmuch she trusted me? Or something more sinister?\\nThere was something else; something I needed to check. Dr. West—the\\ndoctor who had treated Alicia. An important character witness, with vital\\ninformation on her state of mind at the time of the murder. Yet Dr. West\\nhadn’t testified at Alicia’s trial. Why not? No mention was made of him at\\nall. Until I saw his name in her diary, it was as if he didn’t exist. How much\\ndid he know? Why had he not come forward?\\nDr. West.\\nIt couldn’t be the same man. It had to be a coincidence, surely. I needed\\nto find out.\\nI put the diary in my desk drawer, locking it. Then, almost immediately, I\\nchanged my mind. I unlocked the drawer and took out the diary. Better keep\\nit on me—safer not to let it out of my sight. I slipped it into the pocket of\\nmy coat and slung it over my arm. I left my office. I went downstairs and walked along the corridor until I\\nreached a door at the end.\\nI stood there for a moment, looking at it. A name was inscribed on a\\nsmall sign on the door: DR. C. WEST.\\nI didn’t bother to knock. I opened the door and went inside. CHAPTER TWO\\nCHRISTIAN WAS SITTING BEHIND HIS DESK, eating takeaway sushi with\\nchopsticks. He looked up and frowned.\\n“Don’t you know how to knock?”\\n“I need a word.”\\n“Not now, I’m in the middle of lunch.”\\n“This won’t take long. Just a quick question. Did you ever treat Alicia\\nBerenson?”\\nChristian swallowed a mouthful of rice and gave me a blank look. “What\\ndo you mean? You know I do. I’m in charge of her care team.”\\n“I don’t mean here—I mean before she was admitted to the Grove.”\\nI watched Christian closely. His expression told me all I needed to know.\\nHis face went red and he lowered the chopsticks.\\n“What are you talking about?”\\nI took out Alicia’s diary from my pocket and held it up.\\n“You might be interested in this. It’s Alicia’s journal. It was written in the\\nmonths leading up to the murder. I’ve read it.”\\nChristian looked surprised and a little alarmed. “Where the hell did you\\nget that?”\\n“Alicia gave it to me. I’ve read it.”\\n“What’s it got to do with me?”\\n“She mentions you in it.”\\n“Me?”\\n“Apparently you were seeing her privately before she was admitted to the\\nGrove. I wasn’t aware of that.”\\n“I—don’t understand. There must be some mistake.”\\n“I don’t think so. You saw her as a private patient over several years. And\\nyet you didn’t come forward to testify at the trial—despite the importance\\nof your evidence. Nor did you admit you already knew Alicia when you started working here. Presumably she recognized you straightaway—it’s\\nlucky for you she’s silent.”\\nI said this drily, but I was intensely angry. Now I understood why\\nChristian was so against my trying to get Alicia to talk. It was in his every\\ninterest to keep her quiet.\\n“You’re a selfish son of a bitch, Christian, you know that?”\\nChristian stared at me with an increasing look of dismay. “Fuck,” he said\\nunder his breath. “Fuck. Theo. Listen—it’s not what it looks like.”\\n“Isn’t it?”\\n“What else does it say in the diary?”\\n“What else is there to say?”\\nChristian didn’t answer the question. He held out his hand. “Can I have a\\nlook at it?”\\n“Sorry.” I shook my head. “I don’t think that’s appropriate.”\\nChristian played with his chopsticks as he spoke. “I shouldn’t have done\\nit. But it was entirely innocent. You’ve got to believe me.”\\n“I’m afraid I don’t. If it were innocent, why didn’t you come forward\\nafter the murder?”\\n“Because I wasn’t really Alicia’s doctor—I mean, not officially. I only\\ndid it as a favor to Gabriel. We were friends. We were at university together.\\nI was at their wedding. I hadn’t seen him for years—until he called me,\\nlooking for a psychiatrist for his wife. She’d become unwell following her\\nfather’s death.”\\n“And you volunteered your services?”\\n“No, not at all. Quite the reverse. I wanted to refer him to a colleague, but\\nhe insisted I see her. Gabriel said Alicia was extremely resistant to the\\nwhole idea, and the fact I was a friend of his made it much more likely\\nshe’d cooperate. I was reluctant, obviously.”\\n“I’m sure you were.”\\nChristian shot me a hurt look. “There’s no need to be sarcastic.”\\n“Where did you treat her?”\\nHe hesitated. “My girlfriend’s house. But as I told you,” he said quickly,\\n“it was unofficial—I wasn’t really her doctor. I rarely saw her. Every now\\nand then, that’s all.”\\n“And on those rare occasions, did you charge a fee?”\\nChristian blinked and avoided my gaze. “Well, Gabriel insisted on\\npaying, so I had no choice—” “Cash, I presume?”\\n“Theo—”\\n“Was it cash?”\\n“Yes, but—”\\n“And did you declare it?”\\nChristian bit his lip and didn’t reply. So the answer was no. That was why\\nhe hadn’t come forward at Alicia’s trial. I wondered how many other\\npatients he was seeing “unofficially” and not declaring the income from\\nthem.\\n“Look. If Diomedes finds out, I—I could lose my job. You know that,\\ndon’t you?” His voice had a pleading note, appealing to my sympathy.\\nBut I had no sympathy for Christian. Only contempt. “Never mind the\\nprofessor. What about the Medical Council? You’ll lose your license.”\\n“Only if you say something. You don’t need to tell anyone. It’s all water\\nunder the bridge at this point, isn’t it? I mean, it’s my career we’re talking\\nabout, for fuck’s sake.”\\n“You should have thought of that before, shouldn’t you?”\\n“Theo, please…”\\nChristian must have hated having to crawl to me like this, but watching\\nhim squirm provided me with no satisfaction, only irritation. I had no\\nintention of betraying him to Diomedes—not yet anyway. He’d be much\\nmore use to me if I kept him dangling.\\n“It’s okay,” I said. “No one else needs to know. For the moment.”\\n“Thank you. Seriously, I mean it. I owe you one.”\\n“Yes, you do. Go on.”\\n“What do you want?”\\n“I want you to talk. I want you to tell me about Alicia.”\\n“What do you want to know?”\\n“Everything.” CHAPTER THREE\\nCHRISTIAN STARED AT ME, playing with his chopsticks. He deliberated for a\\nfew seconds before he spoke.\\n“There’s not much to tell. I don’t know what you want to hear—or where\\nyou want me to start.”\\n“Start at the beginning. You saw her over a number of years?”\\n“No—I mean, yes—but I told you, not as frequently as you make it\\nsound. I saw her two or three times after her father died.”\\n“When was the last time?”\\n“About a week before the murder.”\\n“And how would you describe her mental state?”\\n“Oh…” Christian leaned back in his chair, relaxing now that he was on\\nsafer ground. “She was highly paranoid, delusional—psychotic, even. But\\nshe’d been like this before. She had a long-standing pattern of mood\\nswings. She was always up and down—typical borderline.”\\n“Spare me the fucking diagnosis. Just give me the facts.”\\nChristian gave me a wounded look but decided not to argue. “What do\\nyou want to know?”\\n“Alicia confided in you she was being watched, correct?”\\nChristian gave me a blank look. “Watched?”\\n“Someone was spying on her. I thought she told you about it?”\\nChristian looked at me strangely. Then, to my surprise, he laughed.\\n“What’s so funny?”\\n“You don’t really believe that, do you? The Peeping Tom spying through\\nthe windows?”\\n“You don’t think it’s true?”\\n“Pure fantasy. I should have thought that was obvious.”\\nI nodded at the diary. “She writes about it pretty convincingly. I believed\\nher.” “Well, of course she sounded convincing. I’d have believed her too if I\\nhadn’t known better. She was having a psychotic episode.”\\n“So you keep saying. She doesn’t sound psychotic in the diary. Just\\nscared.”\\n“She had a history—the same thing happened at the place they lived\\nbefore Hampstead. That’s why they had to move. She accused an elderly\\nman across the street of spying on her. Made a huge fuss. Turned out the old\\nguy was blind—couldn’t even see her, let alone spy on her. She was always\\nhighly unstable, but it was her father’s suicide that did it. She never\\nrecovered.”\\n“Did she talk about him with you at all? Her father?”\\nChristian shrugged. “Not really. She would always insist that she loved\\nhim and they had a very normal relationship—as normal as it could be,\\nconsidering her mother killed herself. To be honest, I was lucky to get\\nanything out of Alicia at all. She was pretty uncooperative. She was—well,\\nyou know what she’s like.”\\n“Not as well as you, apparently.” I went on before he could interrupt,\\n“She attempted suicide after her father’s death?”\\nChristian shrugged. “If you like. That’s not what I would call it.”\\n“What would you call it?”\\n“It was suicidal behavior, but I don’t believe she intended to die. She was\\ntoo narcissistic to ever really want to hurt herself. She took an overdose,\\nmore for show than anything else. She was ‘communicating’ her distress to\\nGabriel—she was always trying to get his attention, poor bastard. If I hadn’t\\nhad to respect her confidentiality, I’d have warned him to get the hell out.”\\n“How unfortunate for him that you’re such an ethical man.”\\nChristian winced. “Theo, I know you’re a very empathetic man—that’s\\nwhat makes you such a good therapist—but you’re wasting your time with\\nAlicia Berenson. Even before the murder, she had precious little capacity\\nfor introspection or mentalizing or whatever you want to call it. She was\\nentirely consumed with herself and her art. All the empathy you have for\\nher, all the kindness—she isn’t capable of giving it back. She’s a lost cause.\\nA total bitch.”\\nChristian said this scornfully—and with absolutely no detectable\\nempathy for such a damaged woman. For a second, I wondered if perhaps\\nChristian was borderline, not Alicia. That would make a lot more sense.\\nI stood up. “I’m going to see Alicia. I need some answers.” “From Alicia?” Christian looked startled. “And how do you intend to get\\nthem?”\\n“By asking her.”\\nI walked out. CHAPTER FOUR\\nI WAITED UNTIL AFTER DIOMEDES DISAPPEARED into his office and Stephanie\\nwas in a meeting with the Trust. Then I slipped into the goldfish bowl and\\nfound Yuri.\\n“I need to see Alicia.”\\n“Oh, yes?” Yuri gave me an odd look. “But—I thought the therapy was\\ndiscontinued?”\\n“It was. I need to have a private conversation with her, that’s all.”\\n“Right, I see.” Yuri looked doubtful. “Well, the therapy room is occupied\\n—Indira is seeing patients there for the rest of the afternoon.” He thought\\nfor a second. “The art room is free, if you don’t mind meeting there? It’ll\\nhave to be quick, though.”\\nHe didn’t elaborate but I knew what he meant—we had to be fast, so no\\none noticed and reported us to Stephanie. I was grateful Yuri was on my\\nside; he was obviously a good man. I felt guilty for having misjudged him\\nwhen we first met.\\n“Thanks. I appreciate this.”\\nYuri grinned at me. “I’ll have her there in ten minutes.”\\n*   *   *\\nYuri was as good as his word. Ten minutes later, Alicia and I were in the art\\nroom, sitting opposite each other, across the paint-splattered work surface.\\nI perched on a rickety stool, feeling precarious. Alicia looked perfectly\\npoised as she sat down—as if she were posing for a portrait, or about to\\npaint one.\\n“Thank you for this.” I took out her diary and placed it in front of me.\\n“For allowing me to read it. It means a great deal to me that you entrusted\\nme with something so personal.”\\nI smiled, only to be met by a blank expression. Alicia’s features were\\nhard and unyielding. I wondered if she regretted giving me the diary. Perhaps she felt a sense of shame at having exposed herself so completely?\\nI left a pause, then went on, “The diary ends abruptly, on a cliff-hanger.”\\nI flicked through the journal’s remaining empty pages. “It’s a little like our\\ntherapy together—incomplete, unfinished.”\\nAlicia didn’t speak. She just stared. I don’t know what I’d expected, but\\nnot this. I’d assumed giving me the diary signaled a change of some kind,\\nrepresenting an invitation, an opening, an entry point, yet here I was, back\\nat square one, faced with an impenetrable wall.\\n“You know, I hoped that having spoken to me indirectly—through these\\npages—that you might go one step further and speak to me in person.”\\nNo response.\\n“I think you gave this to me because you wanted to communicate with\\nme. And you did communicate. Reading this told me a great deal about you\\n—how lonely you were, how isolated, how afraid—that your situation was\\na lot more complicated than I had previously appreciated. Your relationship\\nwith Dr. West, for instance.”\\nI glanced at her as I said Christian’s name. I hoped for some kind of\\nreaction, a narrowing of the eyes, a clenched jaw—something, anything—\\nbut there was nothing, not even a blink.\\n“I had no idea you knew Christian West before you were admitted to the\\nGrove. You saw him privately for several years. You obviously recognized\\nhim when he first came to work here—a few months after your arrival. It\\nmust have been confusing when he didn’t acknowledge you. And probably\\nquite upsetting, I imagine?”\\nI asked it as a question, but there was no reply. Christian seemed of little\\ninterest to her. Alicia looked away, bored, disappointed—as if I had missed\\nsome opportunity, gone down the wrong track. She had been expecting\\nsomething from me, something I had failed to deliver.\\nWell, I wasn’t done yet.\\n“There’s something else. The diary raises certain questions—questions\\nthat need answering. Certain things don’t make sense, don’t fit with\\ninformation I have from other sources. Now that you’ve allowed me to read\\nit, I feel obliged to investigate further. I hope you understand that.”\\nI gave Alicia back the diary. She took it and rested her fingers on it. We\\nstared at each other for a moment.\\n“I’m on your side, Alicia,” I said eventually. “You know that, don’t you?”\\nShe didn’t say anything. I took that as a yes. CHAPTER FIVE\\nKATHY WAS GETTING CARELESS. It was inevitable, I suppose. Having gotten\\naway with her infidelity for so long, she started getting lazy.\\nI returned home to find her about to go out.\\n“I’m going for a walk,” she said, pulling on her trainers. “I won’t be\\nlong.”\\n“I could use some exercise. Fancy some company?”\\n“No, I need to practice my lines.”\\n“I can test you on them if you like.”\\n“No.” Kathy shook her head. “It’s easier on my own. I just keep reciting\\nthe speeches—the ones I can’t get my head around, you know, the ones in\\nact two. I walk around the park, repeating them aloud. You should see the\\nlooks I get.”\\nI had to give it to her. Kathy said all of this with perfect sincerity, while\\nmaintaining constant eye contact. She was a remarkable actress.\\nMy acting was also improving. I gave her a warm, open smile. “Have a\\nnice walk.”\\nI followed her after she left the flat. I kept a careful distance, but she\\ndidn’t even look back once. As I said, she was getting careless.\\nShe walked for about five minutes, to the entrance of the park. As she\\nneared it, a man emerged from the shadows. He had his back to me and I\\ncouldn’t see his face. He had dark hair and was well built, taller than me.\\nShe went up to him and he pulled her close. They started kissing. Kathy\\ndevoured his kisses hungrily, surrendering herself to him. It was strange—\\nto say the least—to see another man’s arms around her. His hands groped\\nand fondled her breasts through her clothes.\\nI knew I should hide. I was exposed and in plain sight—if Kathy turned\\naround, she’d be sure to see me. But I couldn’t move. I was transfixed,\\nstaring at a Medusa, turned to stone. Eventually they stopped kissing and walked into the park, arm in arm. I\\nfollowed. It was disorienting. From behind, from a distance, the man didn’t\\nlook dissimilar to me—for a few seconds I had a confused, out-of-body\\nexperience, convinced I was watching myself walking in the park with\\nKathy.\\nKathy led the man toward a wooded area. He followed her into it and\\nthey vanished.\\nI felt a sick feeling of dread in my stomach. My breathing was thick,\\nslow, heavy. Every part of my body was telling me to leave, go, run, run\\naway. But I didn’t. I followed them into the woods.\\nI tried to make as little noise as possible, but twigs crunched under my\\nfeet, and branches clawed at me. I couldn’t see them anywhere—the trees\\ngrew so closely together that I could only see a few feet in front of me.\\nI stopped and listened. I heard a rustling in the trees, but it could have\\nbeen the wind. Then I heard something unmistakable, a low-pitched\\nguttural sound I recognized at once.\\nIt was Kathy moaning.\\nI tried to get closer, but the branches caught me and held me suspended,\\nlike a fly in a web. I stood there in the dim light, breathing in the musty\\nsmell of bark and earth. I listened to Kathy moaning as he fucked her. He\\ngrunted like an animal.\\nI burned with hate. This man had come from nowhere and invaded my\\nlife. He had stolen and seduced and corrupted the one thing in the world\\nthat was precious to me. It was monstrous—supernatural. Perhaps he wasn’t\\nhuman at all, but the instrument of some malevolent deity intent on\\npunishing me. Was God punishing me? Why? What was I guilty of—except\\nfalling in love? Was it that I loved too deeply, too needily? Too much?\\nDid this man love her? I doubted it. Not the way I did. He was just using\\nher; using her body. There was no way he cared for her as I did. I would\\nhave died for Kathy.\\nI would have killed for her.\\nI thought of my father—I knew what he’d do in this situation. He’d\\nmurder the guy. Be a man, I could hear my father shouting. Toughen up.\\nWas that what I should do? Kill him? Dispose of him? It was a way out of\\nthis mess—a way to break the spell, release Kathy and set us free. Once she\\nhad grieved his loss, it would be over, he’d just be a memory, easily\\nforgotten, and we could go on as before. I could do it now, here, in the park. I’d drag him into the pond, plunge his head underwater. I’d hold it there\\nuntil his body convulsed and went limp in my arms. Or I could follow him\\nhome on the tube, stand right behind him on the platform, and—with a\\nsharp shove—push him in the path of an oncoming train. Or creep up\\nbehind him on a deserted street, clutching a brick, and bash out his brains.\\nWhy not?\\nKathy’s moans grew louder suddenly, and I recognized the groans she\\nmade as she climaxed. Then there was a silence … interrupted by a muffled\\ngiggle I knew so well. I could hear the snapping of twigs as they tramped\\nout of the woods.\\nI waited for a few moments. Then I snapped the branches around me and\\nfought my way out of the trees, tearing and scratching my hands to shreds.\\nWhen I emerged from the wood, my eyes were half-blind with tears. I\\nwiped them away with a bleeding fist.\\nI lurched off, going nowhere. I walked round and round like a madman. CHAPTER SIX\\n“JEAN-FELIX?”\\nNo one was at the reception desk, and no one came when I called. I\\nhesitated for a moment, then went into the gallery.\\nI walked along the corridor to where the Alcestis was hanging. Once\\nagain, I looked at the painting. Once again, I tried to read it, and again I\\nfailed. Something about the picture defied interpretation—or else it had\\nsome kind of meaning that I had yet to comprehend. But what?\\nThen—a sharp intake of breath as I noticed something. Behind Alicia, in\\nthe darkness, if you squinted and looked hard at the painting, the darkest\\nparts of the shadows came together—like a hologram that goes from two\\ndimensions to three when you look at it from a certain angle—and a shape\\nburst forth from the shadows … the figure of a man. A man—hiding in the\\ndark. Watching. Spying on Alicia.\\n“What do you want?”\\nThe voice made me jump. I turned around.\\nJean-Felix didn’t look particularly pleased to see me. “What are you\\ndoing here?”\\nI was about to point out the figure of the man in the painting and ask\\nJean-Felix about it, but I something told me it might be a bad idea.\\nInstead I smiled. “I just had a couple more questions. Is now a good\\ntime?”\\n“Not really. I’ve told you everything I know. Surely there can’t be\\nanything else?”\\n“Actually, some new information has come up.”\\n“And what is that?”\\n“Well, for one thing, I didn’t know Alicia was planning on leaving your\\ngallery.”\\nThere was a second’s pause before Jean-Felix answered. His voice\\nsounded tight, like a rubber band about to snap. “What are you talking about?”\\n“Is it true?”\\n“What business is it of yours?”\\n“Alicia is my patient. It’s my intention to get her talking again—but I see\\nnow it might be in your interest if she remains silent.”\\n“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”\\n“Well, as long as no one knows of her wish to leave, you can hold on to\\nher artwork indefinitely.”\\n“What exactly are you accusing me of?”\\n“I’m not accusing you at all. Merely stating a fact.”\\nJean-Felix laughed. “We’ll see about that. I’ll be contacting my lawyer—\\nand making a formal complaint to the hospital.”\\n“I don’t think you will.”\\n“And why is that?”\\n“Well, you see, I haven’t told you how I heard Alicia was planning to\\nleave.”\\n“Whoever told you was lying.”\\n“It was Alicia.”\\n“What?” Jean-Felix looked stunned. “You mean … she spoke?”\\n“In a way. She gave me her diary to read.”\\n“Her—diary?” He blinked a few times, as if he was having trouble\\nprocessing the information. “I didn’t know Alicia kept a diary.”\\n“Well, she did. She describes your last few meetings in some detail.”\\nI didn’t say anything else. I didn’t need to. There was a heavy pause.\\nJean-Felix was silent.\\n“I’ll be in touch,” I said. I smiled and walked out.\\nAs I emerged onto the Soho street, I felt a little guilty for ruffling Jean-\\nFelix’s feathers like that. But it had been intentional—I wanted to see what\\neffect the provocation would have, how he’d react, what he would do.\\nNow I had to wait and see.\\n*   *   *\\nAs I walked through Soho, I phoned Alicia’s cousin, Paul Rose, to let him\\nknow I was coming. I didn’t want to turn up at the house unannounced and\\nrisk a similar reception to last time. The bruise on my head still hadn’t fully\\nhealed. I cradled the phone between my ear and my shoulder as I lit a cigarette. I\\nbarely had time to inhale before the phone was answered, on the first ring. I\\nhoped it would be Paul, not Lydia. I was in luck.\\n“Hello?”\\n“Paul. It’s Theo Faber.”\\n“Oh. Hello, mate. Sorry I’m whispering. Mum’s having her nap, and I\\ndon’t want to disturb her. How’s your head?”\\n“Much better, thanks.”\\n“Good, good. How can I help?”\\n“Well, I’ve received some new information about Alicia. I wanted to talk\\nto you about it.”\\n“What kind of information?”\\nI told him that Alicia had given me her diary to read.\\n“Her diary? I didn’t know she kept one. What does it say?”\\n“It might be easier to talk in person. Are you free today at all?”\\nPaul hesitated. “It might be better if you don’t come to the house. Mother\\nisn’t … well, she wasn’t too happy about your last visit.”\\n“Yes, I gathered that.”\\n“There’s a pub at the end of the road, by the roundabout. The White Bear\\n—”\\n“Yes, I remember it. That sounds fine. What time?”\\n“Around five? I should be able to get away then for a bit.”\\nI heard Lydia shouting in the background. Evidently she had woken up.\\n“I have to go. I’ll see you later.” Paul hung up.\\n*   *   *\\nA few hours later, I was on my way back to Cambridge. On the train, I\\nmade another phone call—to Max Berenson. I hesitated before calling.\\nHe’d already complained to Diomedes once, so he wouldn’t be pleased to\\nhear from me again. But I knew I had no choice.\\nTanya answered. Her cold sounded better, but I could hear the tension in\\nher voice when she realized who I was. “I don’t think—I mean, Max is\\nbusy. He’s in meetings all day.”\\n“I’ll call back.”\\n“I’m not sure that’s a good idea. I—”\\nI could hear Max in the background saying something, and Tanya’s reply:\\n“I’m not saying that, Max.” Max grabbed the phone and spoke to me directly: “I just told Tanya to\\ntell you to fuck off.”\\n“Ah.”\\n“You’ve got a nerve calling here again. I already complained once to\\nProfessor Diomedes.”\\n“Yes, I’m aware of that. Nonetheless some new information has come to\\nlight, and it concerns you directly—so I felt I had no choice but to get in\\ntouch.”\\n“What information?”\\n“It’s a journal Alicia kept in the weeks leading up to the murder.”\\nThere was silence at the other end of the line. I hesitated.\\n“Alicia writes about you in some detail, Max. She said you had romantic\\nfeelings for her. I was wondering if—”\\nThere was a click as he hung up. So far so good. Max had taken the bait\\n—and now I had to wait to see how he’d react.\\nI realized I was a little afraid of Max Berenson, just as Tanya was afraid\\nof him. I remembered her whispered advice to me, to talk to Paul, to ask\\nhim something—what? Something about the night after the accident that\\nkilled Alicia’s mother. I remembered the look on Tanya’s face when Max\\nhad appeared, how she fell silent and presented him with a smile. No, I\\nthought, Max Berenson was not to be underestimated.\\nThat would be a dangerous mistake. CHAPTER SEVEN\\nAS THE TRAIN APPROACHED CAMBRIDGE, the landscape flattened and the\\ntemperature dropped. I did up my coat as I left the station. The wind cut\\ninto my face like a volley of icy razor blades. I made my way to the pub to\\nmeet Paul.\\nThe White Bear was a ramshackle old place—it looked as if several\\nextensions had been added onto the original structure over the years. A\\ncouple of students were braving the wind, sitting outside with their pints in\\nthe beer garden, wrapped up in scarves, smoking. Inside, the temperature\\nwas much warmer, thanks to several roaring fires, which provided a\\nwelcome relief from the cold.\\nI got a drink and looked around for Paul. Several small rooms led off\\nfrom the main bar and the lighting was low. I peered at the figures in the\\nshadows, unsuccessfully trying to spot him. A good place for an illicit\\nrendezvous, I thought. Which, I suppose, is what this was.\\nI found Paul alone in a small room. He was facing away from the door,\\nsitting by the fire. I recognized him at once, on account of his sheer size.\\nHis huge back nearly blocked the fire from sight.\\n“Paul?”\\nHe jumped up and turned around. He looked like a giant in the tiny room.\\nHe had to stoop slightly to avoid hitting the ceiling.\\n“All right?” he said. He looked like he was bracing himself for bad news\\nfrom a doctor. He made some room for me, and I sat down in front of the\\nfire, relieved to feel its warmth on my face and hands.\\n“It’s colder than London here. That wind doesn’t help.”\\n“Comes straight from Siberia, that’s what they say.” Paul continued\\nwithout pausing, clearly in no mood for small talk, “What’s this about a\\ndiary? I never knew Alicia kept a diary.”\\n“Well, she did.”\\n“And she gave it to you?” I nodded.\\n“And? What does it say?”\\n“It specifically details the last couple of months before the murder. And\\nthere are couple of discrepancies I wanted to ask you about.”\\n“What discrepancies?”\\n“Between your account of events and hers.”\\n“What are you talking about?” He put down his pint and gave me a long\\nstare. “What do you mean?”\\n“Well, for one thing, you told me you hadn’t seen Alicia for several years\\nbefore the murder.”\\nPaul hesitated. “Did I?”\\n“And the diary, Alicia says she saw you a few weeks before Gabriel was\\nkilled. She says you came to the house in Hampstead.”\\nI stared at him, sensing him deflate inside. He looked like a boy\\nsuddenly, in a body that was much too big for him. Paul was afraid, it was\\nobvious. He didn’t reply for moment. He shot me a furtive glance.\\n“Can I have a look? At the diary?”\\nI shook my head. “I don’t think that would be appropriate. Anyway, I\\ndidn’t bring it with me.”\\n“Then how do I even know it exists? You could be lying.”\\n“I’m not lying. But you were—you lied to me, Paul. Why?”\\n“It’s none of your business, that’s why.”\\n“I’m afraid it is my business. Alicia’s well-being is my concern.”\\n“Her well-being has got nothing to do with it. I didn’t hurt her.”\\n“I never said you did.”\\n“Well, then.”\\n“Why don’t you tell me what happened?”\\nPaul shrugged. “It’s a long story.” He hesitated, then gave in. He spoke\\nquickly, breathlessly. I sensed his relief at finally telling someone. “I was in\\na bad way. I had a problem, you know—I was gambling and borrowing\\nmoney, and not able to pay it back. I needed some cash to … to put\\neveryone straight.”\\n“And so you asked Alicia? Did she give you the money?”\\n“What does the diary say?”\\n“It doesn’t.”\\nPaul hesitated, then shook his head. “No, she didn’t give me anything.\\nShe said she couldn’t afford to.” Again he was lying. Why?\\n“How did you get the money, then?”\\n“I—I took it out of my savings. I’d appreciate it if you kept this between\\nus—I don’t want my mother to find out.”\\n“I don’t think there’s any reason to involve Lydia in this.”\\n“Really?” Some color came back into Paul’s expression. He looked more\\nhopeful. “Thanks. I appreciate that.”\\n“Did Alicia ever tell you she suspected she was being watched?”\\nPaul lowered his glass and gave me a puzzled look. I could see she\\nhadn’t. “Watched? What do you mean?”\\nI told him the story I had read in the diary—about Alicia’s suspicions she\\nwas being watched by a stranger, and finally her fears that she was under\\nattack in her own home.\\nPaul shook his head. “She wasn’t right in the head.”\\n“You think she imagined it?”\\n“Well, it stands to reason, doesn’t it?” Paul shrugged. “You don’t think\\nsomeone was stalking her? I mean, I suppose it’s possible—”\\n“Yes, it is possible. So I presume she said nothing to you about it?”\\n“Not a word. But Alicia and I never talked much, you know. She was\\nalways pretty silent. We all were, as a family. I remember Alicia saying how\\nweird it was—she’d go to friends’ houses and see other families laugh and\\njoke and have conversations about things, and our house was so silent. We\\nnever talked. Apart from my mum, giving orders.”\\n“And what about Alicia’s father? Vernon? What was he like?”\\n“Vernon didn’t really talk much. He wasn’t right in the head—not after\\nEva died. He was never the same after that. Neither was Alicia, come to\\nthat.”\\n“That reminds me. There was something I wanted to ask you—something\\nTanya mentioned to me.”\\n“Tanya Berenson? You spoke to her?”\\n“Only briefly. She suggested I talk to you.”\\n“Tanya did?” Paul’s cheeks colored. “I—I don’t know her well, but she’s\\nalways been very kind to me. She’s a good, very good person. She visited\\nme and Mum a couple of times.” A smile appeared on Paul’s lips and he\\nlooked far away for a moment.\\nHe has a crush on her, I thought. I wondered how Max felt about that.\\n“What did Tanya say?” he asked. “She suggested I ask you about something—that happened the night after\\nthe car accident. She didn’t go into detail.”\\n“Yes, I know what she means—I told her during the trial. I asked her not\\ntell to anyone.”\\n“She didn’t tell me. It’s up to you to tell me. If you wish to. Of course, if\\nyou don’t want to…”\\nPaul drained his pint and shrugged. “It’s probably nothing, but—it might\\nhelp you understand Alicia. She…” He hesitated and fell silent.\\n“Go on.”\\n“Alicia … the first thing Alicia did, when she got home from the hospital\\n—they kept her in for a night after the crash—was she climbed up onto the\\nroof of the house. I did too. We sat up there all night, pretty much. We used\\nto go there all the time, Alicia and me. It was our secret place.”\\n“On the roof?”\\nPaul hesitated. He looked at me for a second, deliberating. He made a\\ndecision.\\n“Come on.” He stood up. “I’ll show you.” CHAPTER EIGHT\\nTHE HOUSE WAS IN DARKNESS as we approached.\\n“Here it is,” Paul said. “Follow me.”\\nAn iron ladder was attached to the side of the house. We made our way\\nover to it. The mud was frozen beneath our feet, sculpted into hard ripples\\nand ridges. Without waiting for me, Paul started climbing up.\\nIt was getting colder by the minute. I was wondering if this was such a\\ngood idea. I followed him and gripped the first rung—icy and slippery. It\\nwas overgrown with some kind of climbing plant; ivy, perhaps.\\nI made my way up, rung by rung. By the time I reached the top, my\\nfingers were numb and the wind was slashing my face. I climbed over, onto\\nthe roof. Paul was waiting for me, grinning in an excited, adolescent way.\\nThe razor-thin moon hung above us; the rest was darkness.\\nSuddenly Paul rushed at me, a strange expression on his face. I felt a\\nflicker of panic as his arm reached out toward me—I swerved to avoid it,\\nbut he grabbed hold of me. For a terrifying second I thought he was going\\nto throw me off the roof.\\nInstead he pulled me toward him. “You’re too close to the edge. Stay in\\nthe middle here. It’s safer.”\\nI nodded, catching my breath. This was a bad idea. I didn’t feel remotely\\nsafe around Paul. I was about to suggest climbing down again—then he\\npulled out his cigarettes and offered me one. I hesitated, then I accepted.\\nMy fingers were shaking as I took out my lighter and lit the cigarettes.\\nWe stood there and smoked in silence for a moment.\\n“This is where we would sit. Alicia and me. Every day, pretty much.”\\n“How old were you?”\\n“I was about seven, maybe eight. Alicia couldn’t have been more than\\nten.”\\n“You were a bit young to be climbing ladders.” “I suppose so. Seemed normal to us. When we were teenagers, we’d\\ncome up and smoke and drink beers.”\\nI tried to picture a teenage Alicia, hiding from her father and her bullying\\naunt; Paul, her adoring younger cousin, following up the ladder, pestering\\nher when she’d much rather be silent, alone with her thoughts.\\n“It’s a good hiding place,” I said.\\nPaul nodded. “Uncle Vernon couldn’t make it up the ladder. He had a big\\nbuild, like Mum.”\\n“I could barely make it up myself. That ivy is a death trap.”\\n“It’s not ivy, it’s jasmine.” Paul looked at the green vines that curled over\\nthe top of the ladder. “No flowers yet—not until the spring. Smells like\\nperfume then, when there’s a lot of it.” He seemed lost in a memory for a\\nmoment. “Funny that.”\\n“What?”\\n“Nothing.” He shrugged. “The things you remember … I just was\\nthinking about the jasmine—it was in full bloom that day, the day of the\\naccident, when Eva was killed.”\\nI looked around. “You and Alicia came up here together, you said?”\\nHe nodded. “Mum and Uncle Vernon were looking for us down there. We\\ncould hear them calling. But we didn’t say a word. We stayed hiding. And\\nthat’s when it happened.”\\nHe stubbed out his cigarette and gave me an odd smile. “That’s why I\\nbrought you here. So you can see it—the scene of the crime.”\\n“The crime?”\\nPaul didn’t answer, just kept grinning at me.\\n“What crime, Paul?”\\n“Vernon’s crime. Uncle Vernon wasn’t a good man, you see. No, not at\\nall.”\\n“What are you trying to say?”\\n“Well, that’s when he did it.”\\n“Did what?”\\n“That’s when he killed Alicia.”\\nI stared at Paul, unable to believe my ears. “Killed Alicia? What are you\\ntalking about?”\\nPaul pointed at the ground below. “Uncle Vernon was down there with\\nMum. He was drunk. Mum kept trying to get him to go back inside. But he stood down there, yelling for Alicia. He was so angry with her. He was so\\nmad.”\\n“Because Alicia was hiding? But—she was a child—her mother had just\\ndied.”\\n“He was a mean bastard. The only person he ever cared about was Auntie\\nEva. I suppose that’s why he said it.”\\n“Did what?” I was losing patience. “I don’t understand what you’re\\nsaying to me. What exactly happened?”\\n“Vernon was going on about how much he loved Eva—how he couldn’t\\nlive without her. ‘My girl,’ he kept saying, ‘my poor girl, my Eva … Why\\ndid she have to die? Why did it have to be her? Why didn’t Alicia die\\ninstead?’”\\nI stared at Paul for a second, stunned. I wasn’t sure I understood. “‘Why\\ndidn’t Alicia die instead?’”\\n“That’s what he said.”\\n“Alicia heard this?”\\n“Yeah. And Alicia whispered something to me—I’ll never forget it. ‘He\\nkilled me,’ she said. ‘Dad just—killed me.’”\\nI stared at Paul, speechless. A chorus of bells started ringing in my head,\\nclanging, chiming, reverberating. This was what I’d been looking for. I’d\\nfound it, the missing piece of the jigsaw, at last—here on a roof in\\nCambridge.\\n*   *   *\\nAll the way back to London, I kept thinking about the implications of what\\nI had heard. I understood now why Alcestis had struck a chord with Alicia.\\nJust as Admetus had physically condemned Alcestis to die, so had Vernon\\nRose psychically condemned his daughter to death. Admetus must have\\nloved Alcestis, on some level, but there was no love in Vernon Rose, just\\nhate. He had committed psychic infanticide—and Alicia knew it.\\n“He killed me,” she said. “Dad just killed me.”\\nNow, at last, I had something to work with. Something I knew about—\\nthe emotional effects of psychological wounds on children, and how they\\nmanifest themselves later in adults. Imagine it—hearing your father, the\\nvery person you depend upon for your survival, wishing you dead. How\\nterrifying that must be for a child, how traumatizing—how your sense of\\nself-worth would implode, and the pain would be too great, too huge to feel, so you’d swallow it, repress it, bury it. Over time you would lose contact\\nwith the origins of your trauma, dissociate the roots of its cause, and forget.\\nBut one day, all the hurt and anger would burst forth, like fire from a\\ndragon’s belly—and you’d pick up a gun. You’d visit that rage not upon\\nyour father, who was dead and forgotten and out of reach—but upon your\\nhusband, the man who had taken his place in your life, who loved you and\\nshared your bed. You’d shoot him five times in the head, without possibly\\neven knowing why.\\nThe train raced through the night back to London. At last, I thought—at\\nlast I knew how to reach her.\\nNow we could begin. CHAPTER NINE\\nI SAT WITH ALICIA IN SILENCE.\\nI was getting better at these silences, better at enduring them, settling into\\nthem and toughing it out; it had become almost comfortable, sitting in that\\nsmall room with her, keeping quiet.\\nAlicia held her hands in her lap, clenching and unclenching them\\nrhythmically, like a heartbeat. She was facing me, not looking at me, but\\ngazing out of the window through the bars. It had stopped raining, and the\\nclouds momentarily parted to reveal a pale blue sky; then another cloud\\nappeared, obscuring it with gray. Then I spoke.\\n“There’s something I have become aware of. Something your cousin told\\nme.”\\nI said this as gently as I could. She didn’t react, so I went on.\\n“Paul said that when you were a child, you overheard your father say\\nsomething devastating. After the car accident that killed your mother …\\nyou heard him say that he wished you had died, instead of her.”\\nI was certain there would be a knee-jerk physical reaction, an\\nacknowledgment of some kind. I waited, but none came.\\n“I wonder how you feel about Paul telling me this—it might seem like a\\nbetrayal of confidence. But I believe he had your best interests in mind. You\\nare, after all, in my care.”\\nNo response. I hesitated.\\n“It might help you if I tell you something. No—perhaps that’s being\\ndisingenuous—perhaps it’s me it would help. The truth is I understand you\\nbetter than you think. Without wishing to disclose too much, you and I\\nexperienced similar kinds of childhoods, with similar kinds of fathers. And\\nwe both left home as soon as we could. But we soon discovered that\\ngeographical distance counts for little in the world of the psyche. Some\\nthings are not so easily left behind. I know how damaging your childhood was. It’s important you understand how serious this is. What your father\\nsaid is tantamount to psychic murder. He killed you.”\\nThis time she reacted.\\nShe looked up sharply—straight at me. Her eyes seemed to burn right\\nthrough me. If looks could kill, I would have dropped dead. I met her\\nmurderous gaze without flinching.\\n“Alicia. This is our last chance. I’m sitting here now without Professor\\nDiomedes’s knowledge or permission. If I keep breaking the rules like this\\nfor your sake, I’m going to get fired. That’s why this will be the last time\\nyou see me. Do you understand?”\\nI said this without any expectation or emotion, drained of hope or feeling.\\nI was sick of bashing my head against a wall. I didn’t expect any kind of\\nresponse. And then …\\nI thought I imagined it at first. I thought I was hearing things. I stared at\\nher, breathless. I felt my heart thudding in my chest. My mouth was dry\\nwhen I spoke.\\n“Did—did you just … say something?”\\nAnother silence. I must have been mistaken. I must have imagined it. But\\nthen … it happened again.\\nAlicia’s lips moved slowly, painfully; her voice cracked a little as it\\nemerged, like a creaking gate that needed oiling.\\n“What…” she whispered. Then she stopped. And again: “What … what\\n—”\\nFor a moment we just stared at each other. My eyes slowly filled with\\ntears—tears of disbelief, excitement, and gratitude.\\n“What do I want? I want you to keep talking.… Talk—talk to me, Alicia\\n—”\\nAlicia stared at me. She was thinking about something. She came to a\\ndecision.\\nShe slowly nodded. “Okay.” CHAPTER TEN\\n“SHE SAID WHAT?”\\nProfessor Diomedes stared at me with a look of stunned amazement. We\\nwere outside, smoking. I could tell he was excited because he had dropped\\nhis cigar on the ground without even noticing. “She spoke? Alicia really\\nspoke?”\\n“She did.”\\n“Incredible. So you were right. You were right. And I was wrong.”\\n“Not at all. It was wrong of me to see her without your permission,\\nProfessor. I’m sorry, I just had an instinct…”\\nDiomedes waved away my apology and finished my sentence for me.\\n“You followed your gut. I would have done the same, Theo. Well done.”\\nI was unwilling to be too celebratory. “We mustn’t count our chickens\\nyet. It’s a breakthrough, yes. But there’s no guarantee—she might revert or\\nregress at any point.”\\nDiomedes nodded. “Quite right. We must organize a formal review and\\ninterview Alicia as soon as possible—get her in front of a panel—you and\\nme and someone from the Trust—Julian will do, he’s harmless enough—”\\n“You’re going too fast. You’re not listening to me. That’s too soon.\\nAnything like that will scare her. We need to move slowly.”\\n“Well, it’s important the Trust knows—”\\n“No, not yet. Maybe this was a one-off. Let’s wait. Let’s not make any\\nannouncements. Not just yet.”\\nDiomedes nodded, taking this in. His hand reached for my shoulder and\\ngripped it. “Well done. I’m proud of you.”\\nI felt a small flicker of pride—a son congratulated by his father. I was\\nconscious of my desire to please Diomedes, justify his faith in me and make\\nhim proud. I felt a little emotional. I lit a cigarette to disguise it. “What\\nnow?”\\n“Now you keep going. Keep working with Alicia.” “And if Stephanie finds out?”\\n“Forget Stephanie—leave her to me. You focus on Alicia.”\\nAnd so I did.\\n*   *   *\\nDuring our next session, Alicia and I talked nonstop. Or rather, Alicia\\ntalked and I listened. Listening to Alicia was an unfamiliar and somewhat\\ndisconcerting experience, after so much silence. She spoke hesitantly at\\nfirst, tentatively—trying to walk on legs that hadn’t been used in a while.\\nShe soon found her feet, picking up speed and agility, tripping through\\nsentences as if she had never been silent, which in a way, she hadn’t.\\nWhen the session ended, I went to my office. I sat at the desk,\\ntranscribing what had been said while it was still fresh in my mind. I wrote\\ndown everything, word for word, capturing it as precisely and accurately as\\npossible.\\nAs you will see, it’s an incredible story—of that there is no doubt.\\nWhether you believe it or not is up to you. CHAPTER ELEVEN\\nALICIA SAT IN THE CHAIR opposite me in the therapy room.\\n“Before we begin, I have some questions for you. A few things I’d like to\\nclarify…”\\nNo reply. Alicia looked at me with that unreadable look of hers.\\n“Specifically, I want to understand your silence. I want to know why you\\nrefused to speak.”\\nAlicia seemed disappointed by the question. She turned and looked out\\nthe window.\\nWe sat like that in silence for a minute or so. I tried to contain the\\nsuspense I was feeling. Had the breakthrough been temporary? Would we\\nnow go on as before? I couldn’t let that happen.\\n“Alicia. I know it’s difficult. But once you start talking to me, you’ll find\\nit easier, I promise.”\\nNo response.\\n“Try. Please. Don’t give up when you’ve made such progress. Keep\\ngoing. Tell me … tell me why you wouldn’t speak.”\\nAlicia turned back and stared at me with a chilly gaze. She spoke in a\\nlow voice:\\n“Nothing … nothing to say.”\\n“I’m not sure I believe that. I think there was too much too say.”\\nA pause. A shrug. “Perhaps. Perhaps … you’re right.”\\n“Go on.”\\nShe hesitated. “At first, when Gabriel … when he was dead—I couldn’t,\\nI tried … but I couldn’t … talk. I opened my mouth—but no sound came\\nout. Like in a dream … where you try to scream … but can’t.”\\n“You were in a state of shock. But over the next few days, you must have\\nfound your voice returning to you…?”\\n“By then … it seemed pointless. It was too late.”\\n“Too late? To speak in your defense?” Alicia held me in her gaze, a cryptic smile on her lips. She didn’t speak.\\n“Tell me why you started talking again.”\\n“You know the answer.”\\n“Do I?”\\n“Because of you.”\\n“Me?” I looked at her with surprise.\\n“Because you came here.”\\n“And that made a difference?”\\n“All the difference—it made … all the difference.” Alicia lowered her\\nvoice and stared at me, unblinking. “I want you to understand—what\\nhappened to me. What it felt like. It’s important … you understand.”\\n“I want to understand. That’s why you gave me the diary, isn’t it?\\nBecause you want me to understand. It seems to me the people who\\nmattered most to you didn’t believe your story about the man. Perhaps\\nyou’re wondering … if I believe you.”\\n“You believe me.” This was not a question but a simple statement of fact.\\nI nodded. “Yes, I believe you. So why don’t we start there? The last diary\\nentry you wrote described the man breaking into the house. What happened\\nthen?”\\n“Nothing.”\\n“Nothing?”\\nShe shook her head. “It wasn’t him.”\\n“It wasn’t? Then who was it?”\\n“It was Jean-Felix. He wanted—he had come to talk about the\\nexhibition.”\\n“Judging by your diary, it doesn’t seem you were in the right state of\\nmind for visitors.”\\nAlicia acknowledged this with a shrug.\\n“Did he stay long?”\\n“No. I asked him to leave. He didn’t want to—he was upset. He shouted\\nat me a bit—but he went after a while.”\\n“And then? What happened after Jean-Felix left?”\\nAlicia shook her head. “I don’t want to talk about that.”\\n“No?”\\n“Not yet.”\\nAlicia’s eyes looked into mine for a moment. Then they darted to the\\nwindow, considering the darkening sky beyond the bars. Something in the way she was tilting her head was almost coquettish, and the beginning of a\\nsmile was forming at the corner of her mouth. She’s enjoying this, I\\nthought. Having me in her power.\\n“What do you want to talk about?” I asked.\\n“I don’t know. Nothing. I just want to talk.”\\nSo we talked. We talked about Lydia and Paul, and about her mother, and\\nthe summer she died. We talked about Alicia’s childhood—and mine. I told\\nher about my father, and growing up in that house; she seemed curious to\\nknow as much as possible about my past and what had shaped me and made\\nme who I am.\\nI remember thinking, There’s no going back now. We were crashing\\nthrough every last boundary between therapist and patient. Soon it would be\\nimpossible to tell who was who. CHAPTER TWELVE\\nTHE NEXT MORNING, we met again. Alicia seemed different that day\\nsomehow—more reserved, more guarded. I think it’s because she was\\npreparing herself to talk about the day of Gabriel’s death.\\nShe sat opposite me and, unusually for her, looked straight at me and\\nmaintained eye contact throughout. She started speaking without being\\nprompted; slowly, thoughtfully, choosing each phrase with care, as if\\ncautiously applying brushstrokes to a canvas.\\n“I was alone that afternoon. I knew I had to paint, but it was so hot, I\\ndidn’t think I could face it. But I decided to try. So I took the little fan I’d\\nbought down to the studio in the garden, and then…”\\n“And then?”\\n“My phone rang. It was Gabriel. He was calling to say he’d be back late\\nfrom the shoot.”\\n“Did he normally do that? Call to say he’d be late?”\\nAlicia gave me an odd look, as if it struck her as a strange question. She\\nshook her head. “No. Why?”\\n“I wondered if he might be calling for another reason. To see how you\\nwere feeling? Judging from your diary, it sounds like he was concerned\\nabout your mental state.”\\n“Oh.” Alicia pondered this, taken aback. She slowly nodded. “I see. Yes,\\nyes, possibly…”\\n“I’m sorry—I interrupted you. Go on. What happened after the phone\\ncall?”\\nAlicia hesitated. “I saw him.”\\n“Him?”\\n“The man. I mean, I saw his reflection. Reflected in the window. He was\\ninside—inside the studio. Standing right behind me.”\\nAlicia shut her eyes and sat quite still. There was a long pause.\\nI spoke gently. “Can you describe him? What did he look like?” She opened her eyes and stared at me for a moment. “He was tall.…\\nStrong. I couldn’t see his face—he had put on a mask, a black mask. But I\\ncould see his eyes—they were dark holes. No light in them at all.”\\n“What did you do when you saw him?”\\n“Nothing. I was so scared. I kept looking at him. He had a knife in his\\nhand. I asked what he wanted. He didn’t speak. And I said I had money in\\nthe kitchen, in my bag. And he shook his head and said, ‘I don’t want\\nmoney.’ And he laughed. A horrible laugh, like breaking glass. He held the\\nknife up to my neck. The sharp end of the blade was against my throat,\\nagainst my skin.… He told me to go with him into the house.”\\nAlicia shut her eyes as she remembered it. “He led me out of the studio,\\nonto the lawn. We walked towards the house. I could see the gate to the\\nstreet, just a few meters away—I was so close to it.… And something in me\\ntook over. It was—it was my only chance to escape. So I kicked him hard\\nand broke away from him. And I ran. I ran for the gate.” Her eyes opened\\nand she smiled at the memory. “For a few seconds, I was free.”\\nHer smile faded.\\n“Then—he jumped on me. On my back. We fell to the ground.… His\\nhand was over my mouth, and I felt the cold blade against my throat. He\\nsaid he’d kill me if I moved. We lay there for a few seconds, and I could\\nfeel his breath on my face. It stank. Then he pulled me up—and dragged me\\ninto the house.”\\n“And then? What happened?”\\n“He locked the door. And I was trapped.”\\nAlicia’s breathing was heavy and her cheeks were flushed. I was\\nconcerned she was becoming distressed, and I was wary of pushing her too\\nhard.\\n“Do you need a break?”\\nShe shook her head. “Let’s keep going. I’ve waited long enough to say\\nthis. I want to get it over with.”\\n“Are you sure? It might be a good idea to take a moment.”\\nShe hesitated. “Can I have a cigarette?”\\n“A cigarette? I didn’t know you smoked.”\\n“I don’t. I—I used to. Can you give me one?”\\n“How do you know I smoke?”\\n“I can smell it on you.” “Oh.” I smiled, feeling a little embarrassed. “Okay.” I stood up. “Let’s go\\noutside.” CHAPTER THIRTEEN\\nTHE COURTYARD WAS POPULATED WITH PATIENTS. They were huddled about in\\ntheir usual groups, gossiping, arguing, smoking; some were hugging\\nthemselves and stamping their feet to keep warm.\\nAlicia put a cigarette to her lips, holding it between her long thin fingers.\\nI lit it for her. As the flame caught the tip of her cigarette, it crackled and\\nglowed red. She inhaled deeply, her eyes on mine. She seemed almost\\namused.\\n“Aren’t you going to smoke? Or is that inappropriate? Sharing a cigarette\\nwith a patient?”\\nShe’s making fun of me, I thought. But she was right to—no regulation\\nprohibited a member of staff and a patient from having a cigarette together.\\nBut if staff smoked, they tended to do it covertly, sneaking to the fire escape\\nat the back of the building. They certainly didn’t do it in front of the\\npatients. To stand here in the courtyard and smoke with her did feel like a\\ntransgression. I was probably imagining it, but I felt we were being\\nwatched. I sensed Christian spying on us from the window. His words came\\nback to me: “Borderlines are so seductive.” I looked into Alicia’s eyes.\\nThey weren’t seductive; they weren’t even friendly. A fierce mind was\\nbehind those eyes, a sharp intelligence that was only just waking up. She\\nwas a force to be reckoned with, Alicia Berenson. I understood that now.\\nPerhaps that’s why Christian had felt the need to sedate her. Was he\\nscared of what she might do—what she might say? I felt a little scared of\\nher myself; not scared, exactly—but alert, apprehensive. I knew I had to\\nwatch my step.\\n“Why not?” I said. “I’ll have one too.”\\nI put a cigarette in my mouth and lit it. We smoked in silence for a\\nmoment, maintaining eye contact, only inches from each other, until I felt a\\nstrange adolescent embarrassment and averted my gaze. I tried to cover it\\nby gesturing at the courtyard. “Shall we walk and talk?”\\nAlicia nodded. “Okay.”\\nWe started walking around the wall, along the perimeter of the courtyard.\\nThe other patients watched us. I wondered what they were thinking. Alicia\\ndidn’t seem to care. She didn’t even seem to notice them. We walked in\\nsilence for a moment.\\nEventually she said, “Do you want me to go on?”\\n“If you want to, yes … Are you ready?”\\nAlicia nodded. “Yes, I am.”\\n“What happened once you were inside the house?”\\n“The man said … he said he wanted a drink. So I gave him one of\\nGabriel’s beers. I don’t drink beer. I didn’t have anything else in the house.”\\n“And then?”\\n“He talked.”\\n“What about?”\\n“I don’t remember.”\\n“You don’t?”\\n“No.”\\nShe lapsed into silence.\\nI waited as long as I could bear before prompting her, “Let’s keep going.\\nYou were in the kitchen. How were you feeling?”\\n“I don’t … I don’t remember feeling anything at all.”\\nI nodded. “That’s not uncommon in these situations. It’s not just a case of\\nflight-or-fight responses. There’s a third, equally common response when\\nwe’re under attack—we freeze.”\\n“I didn’t freeze.”\\n“No?”\\n“No.” She shot me a fierce look. “I was preparing myself. I was getting\\nready … ready to fight. Ready to—kill him.”\\n“I see. And how did you intend to do that?”\\n“Gabriel’s gun. I knew I had to get to the gun.”\\n“It was in the kitchen? You had put it there? That’s what you wrote in the\\ndiary.”\\nAlicia nodded. “Yes, in the cupboard by the window.” She inhaled deeply\\nand blew out a long line of smoke. “I told him I needed some water. I went\\nto get a glass. I walked across the kitchen—it took forever to walk a few feet. Step by step, I reached the cupboard. My hand was shaking.… I\\nopened it.…”\\n“And?”\\n“The cupboard was empty. The gun was gone. And then I heard him say,\\n‘The glasses are in the cupboard to your right.’ I turned around, and the gun\\nwas there—in his hand. He was pointing it at me, and laughing.”\\n“And then?”\\n“Then?”\\n“What were you thinking?”\\n“That it had been my last chance to escape, and now—now he was going\\nto kill me.”\\n“You believed he was going to kill you?”\\n“I knew he was.”\\n“But then why did he delay? Why not do it as soon as he broke into the\\nhouse?”\\nAlicia didn’t answer. I glanced at her. To my surprise, a smile was on her\\nlips.\\n“When I was young, Aunt Lydia had a kitten. A tabby cat. I didn’t like\\nher much. She was wild, and she’d go for me sometimes with her claws.\\nShe was unkind—and cruel.”\\n“Don’t animals act out of instinct? Can they be cruel?”\\nAlicia looked at me intently. “They can be cruel. She was. She would\\nbring in things from the field—mice or little birds she’d caught. And they\\nwere always half-alive. Wounded, but alive. She’d keep them like that and\\nplay with them.”\\n“I see. It sounds like you’re saying you were this man’s prey? That he\\nwas playing some kind of sadistic game with you. Is that right?”\\nAlicia dropped the end of her cigarette on the ground and stepped on it.\\n“Give me another one.”\\nI handed her the pack. She took one and lit the cigarette herself. She\\nsmoked for a moment. “Gabriel was coming home at eight. Two more\\nhours. I kept staring at the clock. ‘What’s the matter?’ he said. ‘Don’t you\\nlike spending time with me?’ And he stroked my skin with the gun, running\\nit up and down my arm.” She shivered at the memory. “I said Gabriel was\\ngoing to be home any minute. ‘And what then?’ he asked. ‘He’ll rescue\\nyou?’”\\n“And what did you say?” “I didn’t say anything. I just kept staring at the clock … and then my\\nphone rang. It was Gabriel. He told me to answer it. He held the gun against\\nmy head.”\\n“And? What did Gabriel say?”\\n“He said … he said the shoot was turning into a nightmare, so I should\\ngo ahead and eat without him. He wouldn’t get back until ten at the earliest.\\nI hung up. ‘My husband is on his way home,’ I said. ‘He’ll be here in a few\\nminutes. You should go, now, before he gets back.’ The man just laughed.\\n‘But I heard him say he won’t be back until ten,’ he said. ‘We’ve got hours\\nto kill. Get me some rope,’ he said, ‘or tape or something. I want to tie you\\nup.’\\n“I did as he asked. I knew it was hopeless now. I knew how it was going\\nto end.”\\nAlicia stopped talking and looked at me. I could see the raw emotion in\\nher eyes. I wondered if I was pushing her too hard.\\n“Maybe we should take a break.”\\n“No, I need to finish. I need to do this.”\\nShe went on, speaking faster now. “I didn’t have any rope, so he took the\\nwire I had for hanging canvases. He made me go in the living room. He\\npulled out one of the upright chairs from the dining table. He told me to sit\\ndown. He started wrapping the wire around my ankles, tying me to the\\nchair. I could feel it cutting into me. ‘Please,’ I said, ‘please—’ But he\\ndidn’t listen. He tied my wrists behind my back. I was sure then that he was\\ngoing to kill me. I wish … I wish he had.”\\nShe spat this out. I was startled by her vehemence.\\n“Why do you wish that?”\\n“Because what he did was worse.”\\nFor a second I thought Alicia was going to cry. I fought a sudden desire\\nto hold her, take her in my arms, kiss her, reassure her, promise her she was\\nsafe. I restrained myself. I stubbed out my cigarette on the redbrick wall.\\n“I feel that you need to be taken care of. I find myself wanting to take\\ncare of you, Alicia.”\\n“No.” She shook her head firmly. “That’s not what I want from you.”\\n“What do you want?”\\nAlicia didn’t answer. She turned and walked back inside. CHAPTER FOURTEEN\\nI TURNED ON THE LIGHT in the therapy room and shut the door. When I turned\\naround, Alicia had already sat down—but not in her chair. She was sitting\\nin my chair.\\nNormally I would have explored the meaning of this telling gesture with\\nher. Now, however, I said nothing. If sitting in my chair signified she had\\nthe upper hand—well, she did. I was impatient to get to the end of her story,\\nnow that we were so close to it. So I just sat down and waited for her to\\nspeak. She half shut her eyes and was perfectly still.\\nEventually she said, “I was tied to the chair, and every time I squirmed,\\nthe wire cut deeper into my legs, and they were bleeding. It was a relief to\\nfocus on the cutting instead of my thoughts. My thoughts were too scary.…\\nI thought I would never see Gabriel again. I thought I was going to die.”\\n“What happened next?”\\n“We sat there for what seemed like forever. It’s funny. I’ve always\\nthought of fear as a cold sensation, but it’s not—it burns like fire. It was so\\nhot in that room, with the windows closed and the blinds drawn. Still,\\nstifling, heavy air. Beads of sweat were dripping down my forehead and\\ninto my eyes, stinging them. I could smell the alcohol on him and the stink\\nof his sweat while he drank and talked—he kept talking. I didn’t listen to a\\nlot of it. I could hear a big fat fly, buzzing between the blind and the\\nwindow—it was trapped and thudding against the glass, thud, thud, thud.\\nHe asked questions about me and Gabriel—how we met, how long we’d\\nbeen together, if we were happy. I thought if I could keep him talking, I had\\na better chance of staying alive. So I answered his questions—about me,\\nGabriel, my work. I talked about whatever he wanted. Just to buy time. I\\nkept focusing on the clock. Listening to it tick. And then suddenly it was\\nten o’clock.… And then … ten-thirty. And still Gabriel hadn’t come home.\\n“‘He’s late,’ he said. ‘Maybe he’s not coming.’\\n“‘He’s coming,’ I said. “‘Well, it’s a good thing I’m here to keep you company.’\\n“And then the clock struck eleven, and I heard a car outside. The man\\nwent to the window and looked out. ‘Perfect timing,’ he said.”\\n*   *   *\\nWhat happened next—Alicia said—happened fast.\\nThe man grabbed Alicia and swung her chair around, so she faced away\\nfrom the door. He said he would shoot Gabriel in the head if she spoke one\\nword or made a single sound. Then he disappeared. A moment later the\\nlights fused and everything went dark. In the hallway, the front door opened\\nand closed.\\n“Alicia?” Gabriel called out.\\nThere was no reply, and he called her name again. He walked into the\\nliving room—and saw her by the fireplace, sitting with her back to him.\\n“Why are you sitting in the dark?” Gabriel asked. No reply. “Alicia?”\\nAlicia fought to remain silent—she wanted to cry out, but her eyes had\\nbecome accustomed to the dark and she could see in front of her, in the\\ncorner of the room, the man’s gun glinting in the shadows. He was pointing\\nit at Gabriel. Alicia kept silent for his sake.\\n“Alicia?” Gabriel walked toward her. “What’s wrong?”\\nJust as Gabriel reached out his hand to touch her, the man leaped from\\nthe darkness. Alicia screamed, but it was too late—and Gabriel was\\nknocked to the floor; the man on top of him. The gun was raised like a\\nhammer and brought down onto Gabriel’s head with a sickening thud—\\nonce, twice, three times—and he lay there, unconscious, bleeding. The man\\npulled him up and sat Gabriel on a chair. He tied him to it, using the wire.\\nGabriel stirred as he regained consciousness.\\n“What the fuck? What—”\\nThe man raised the gun and aimed it at Gabriel. There was a gunshot.\\nAnd another. And another. Alicia started screaming. The man kept firing.\\nHe shot Gabriel in the head six times. Then he tossed the gun to the floor.\\nHe left without saying a word. CHAPTER FIFTEEN\\nSO THERE YOU HAVE IT. Alicia Berenson didn’t kill her husband. A faceless\\nintruder broke into their home and, in an apparently motiveless act of\\nmalice, shot Gabriel dead before vanishing into the night. Alicia was\\nentirely innocent.\\nThat’s if you believe her explanation.\\nI didn’t. Not a word of it.\\nApart from her obvious inconsistencies and inaccuracies—such as that\\nGabriel was not shot six times, but only five, one of the bullets being fired\\nat the ceiling; nor was Alicia discovered tied to a chair, but standing in the\\nmiddle of the room, having slashed her wrists. Alicia made no mention to\\nme of the man’s untying her, nor did she explain why she hadn’t told the\\npolice this version of events from the start. No, I knew she was lying. I was\\nannoyed that she had lied, badly and pointlessly, to my face. For a second I\\nwondered if she was testing me, seeing whether I accepted the story? If so, I\\nwas determined to give nothing away.\\nI sat there in silence.\\nUnusually, Alicia spoke first. “I’m tired. I want to stop.”\\nI nodded. I couldn’t object.\\n“Let’s carry on tomorrow,” she said.\\n“Is there more to say?”\\n“Yes. One last thing.”\\n“Very well. Tomorrow.”\\nYuri was waiting in the corridor. He escorted Alicia to her room, and I\\nwent up to my office.\\nAs I have said, it’s been my practice for years to transcribe a session as\\nsoon as it’s ended. The ability to accurately record what has been said\\nduring the past fifty minutes is of paramount importance to a therapist—\\notherwise much detail is forgotten and the immediacy of the emotions lost. I sat at my desk and wrote down, as fast as I could, everything that had\\ntranspired between us. The moment I finished, I marched through the\\ncorridors, clutching my pages of notes.\\nI knocked on Diomedes’s door. There was no response, so I knocked\\nagain. Still no answer. I opened the door a crack—and there was Diomedes,\\nfast asleep on his narrow couch.\\n“Professor?” And again, louder: “Professor Diomedes?”\\nHe woke with a start and sat up quickly. He blinked at me.\\n“What is it? What’s wrong?”\\n“I need to talk to you. Should I come back later?”\\nDiomedes frowned and shook his head. “I was having a brief siesta. I\\nalways do, after lunch. It helps me get through the afternoon. It becomes a\\nnecessity as you get older.” He yawned and stood up. “Come in, Theo. Sit\\ndown. By the looks of you, it’s important.”\\n“I think it is, yes.”\\n“Alicia?”\\nI nodded. I sat in front of the desk. He sat down behind it. His hair was\\nsticking up to one side, and he still looked half-asleep.\\n“Are you sure I shouldn’t come back later?”\\nDiomedes shook his head. He poured himself a glass of water from a jug.\\n“I’m awake now. Go on. What it is?”\\n“I’ve been with Alicia, talking.… I need some supervision.”\\nDiomedes nodded. He was looking more awake by the second, and more\\ninterested. “Go on.”\\nI started reading from my notes. I took him through the entire session. I\\nrepeated her words as accurately as I could and relayed the story she had\\ntold me: how the man who’d been spying on her broke into the house, took\\nher prisoner, and shot and killed Gabriel.\\nWhen I finished, there was a long pause. Diomedes’s expression gave\\nlittle away. He pulled a box of cigars out of his desk drawer. He took out a\\nlittle silver guillotine. He popped the end of a cigar into it and sliced it off.\\n“Let’s start with the countertransference. Tell me about your emotional\\nexperience. Start at the beginning. As she was telling you her story, what\\nkind of feelings were coming up?”\\nI thought about it for a moment. “I felt excited, I suppose.… And\\nanxious. Afraid.”\\n“Afraid? Was it your fear, or hers?” “Both, I imagine.”\\n“And what were you afraid of?”\\n“I’m not sure. Fear of failure, perhaps. I have a lot riding on this, as you\\nknow.”\\nDiomedes nodded. “What else?”\\n“Frustration too. I feel frustrated quite frequently during our sessions.”\\n“And angry?”\\n“Yes, I suppose so.”\\n“You feel like a frustrated father, dealing with a difficult child?”\\n“Yes. I want to help her—but I don’t know if she wants to be helped.”\\nHe nodded. “Stay with the feeling of anger. Talk more about it. How does\\nit manifest itself?”\\nI hesitated. “Well, I often leave the sessions with a splitting headache.”\\nDiomedes nodded. “Yes, exactly. It has to come out one way or another.\\n‘A trainee who is not anxious will be sick.’ Who was it who said that?”\\n“I don’t know.” I shrugged. “I’m sick and anxious.”\\nDiomedes smiled. “You’re also no longer a trainee—although those\\nfeelings never go away entirely.” He picked up his cigar. “Let’s go outside\\nfor a smoke.”\\n*   *   *\\nWe went onto the fire escape. Diomedes puffed on his cigar for a moment,\\nmulling things over. Eventually he reached a conclusion.\\n“She’s lying, you know.”\\n“You mean about the man killing Gabriel? I thought so too.”\\n“Not just that.”\\n“Then what?”\\n“All of it. The whole cock-and-bull story. I don’t believe a single word of\\nit.”\\nI must have looked rather taken aback. I had suspected he’d disbelieve\\nsome elements of Alicia’s tale. I hadn’t expected him to reject the whole\\nthing.\\n“You don’t believe in the man?”\\n“No, I don’t. I don’t believe he ever existed. It’s a fantasy. From start to\\nfinish.”\\n“What makes you so sure?” Diomedes gave me a strange smile. “Call it my intuition. Years of\\nprofessional experience with fantasists.” I tried to interrupt but he\\nforestalled me with a wave of his hand. “Of course, I don’t expect you to\\nagree, Theo. You’re in deep with Alicia, and your feelings are bound up\\nwith hers like a tangled ball of wool. That is the purpose of a supervision\\nlike this—to help you unpick the strands of wool—to see what is yours and\\nwhat is hers. And once you gain some distance, and clarity, I suspect you\\nwill feel rather differently about your experience with Alicia Berenson.”\\n“I’m not sure what you mean.”\\n“Well, to be blunt, I fear she has been performing for you. Manipulating\\nyou. And it’s a performance that I believe has been tailored specifically to\\nappeal to your chivalric … and, let’s say, romantic instincts. It was obvious\\nto me from the start that you intended to rescue her. I’m quite sure it was\\nobvious to Alicia too. Hence her seduction of you.”\\n“You sound like Christian. She hasn’t seduced me. I am perfectly capable\\nof withstanding a patient’s sexual projections. Don’t underestimate me,\\nProfessor.”\\n“Don’t underestimate her. She’s giving an excellent performance.”\\nDiomedes shook his head and peered up at the gray clouds. “The vulnerable\\nwoman under attack, alone, in need of protection. Alicia has cast herself as\\nthe victim and this mystery man as the villain. Whereas in fact Alicia and\\nthe man are one and the same. She killed Gabriel. She was guilty—and she\\nis still refusing to accept that guilt. So she splits, dissociates, fantasizes—\\nAlicia becomes the innocent victim and you are her protector. And by\\ncolluding with this fantasy you are allowing her to disown all\\nresponsibility.”\\n“I don’t agree with that. I don’t believe she is lying, consciously, anyway.\\nAt the very least, Alicia believes her story to be true.”\\n“Yes, she believes it. Alicia is under attack—but from her own psyche,\\nnot the outside world.”\\nI knew that wasn’t true, but there was no point in arguing further. I\\nstubbed out my cigarette.\\n“How do you think I should proceed?”\\n“You must force her to confront the truth. Only then will she have a hope\\nof recovery. You must refuse point-blank to accept her story. Challenge her.\\nDemand she tell you the truth.”\\n“And do you think she will?” He shrugged. “That”—he took a long drag on his cigar—“is anyone’s\\nguess.”\\n“Very well. I’ll talk to her tomorrow. I’ll confront her.”\\nDiomedes looked slightly uneasy and opened his mouth as if he was\\nabout to say something further. But he changed his mind. He nodded and\\nstamped on his cigar with an air of finality. “Tomorrow.” CHAPTER SIXTEEN\\nAFTER WORK, I followed kathy to the park again. Sure enough, her lover was\\nwaiting at the same spot they met at last time. They kissed and groped each\\nother like teenagers.\\nKathy glanced in my direction, and for a second I thought she saw me,\\nbut no. She only had eyes for him. I tried to get a better look at him this\\ntime. But I still didn’t see his face properly, though something about his\\nbuild was familiar. I had the feeling I’d seen him before somewhere.\\nThey walked toward Camden and disappeared into a pub, the Rose and\\nCrown, a seedy-looking place. I waited in the café opposite. About an hour\\nlater, they came out. Kathy was all over him, kissing him. They kissed for a\\nwhile by the road. I watched, feeling sick to my stomach, burning with hate.\\nShe eventually said goodbye to him, and they left each other. She started\\nwalking away. The man turned and walked in the opposite direction. I\\ndidn’t follow Kathy.\\nI followed him.\\nHe waited at a bus stop. I stood behind him. I looked at his back, his\\nshoulders; I imagined lunging at him—shoving him under the oncoming\\nbus. But I didn’t push him. He got on the bus. So did I.\\nI assumed he would go directly home, but he didn’t. He changed buses a\\ncouple of times. I followed him from a distance. He went to the East End,\\nwhere he disappeared into a warehouse for half an hour. Then another\\njourney, on another bus. He made a couple of phone calls, speaking in a low\\nvoice and chuckling frequently. I wondered if he was talking to Kathy. I\\nwas feeling increasingly frustrated and disheartened. But I was also\\nstubborn and refused to give up.\\nEventually he made his way home—getting off the bus and turning onto\\na quiet tree-lined street. He was still talking on his phone. I followed him,\\nkeeping my distance. The street was deserted. If had turned around, he\\nwould have seen me. But he didn’t. I passed a house with a rock garden and succulent plants. I acted without\\nthinking—my body seemed to move on its own. My arm reached over the\\nlow wall into the garden and picked up a rock. I could feel its weight in my\\nhands. My hands knew what to do: they had decided to kill him, crack open\\nthe worthless scumbag’s skull. I went along with this, in a mindless trance,\\ncreeping after him, silently gaining ground, getting nearer. Soon I was close\\nenough. I raised the rock, preparing to smash it down on him with all my\\nstrength. I’d knock him to the ground and bash his brains out. I was so\\nclose; if he weren’t still talking on his phone, he’d have heard me.\\nNow: I raised the rock, and—\\nRight behind me, on my left, a front door opened. A sudden buzz of\\nconversation, loud Thank yous and Goodbyes as people left the house. I\\nfroze. Right in front of me, Kathy’s lover stopped and looked in the\\ndirection of the noise, at the house. I stepped aside and hid behind a tree. He\\ndidn’t see me.\\nHe started walking again, but I didn’t follow. The interruption had\\nstartled me out of my reverie. The rock fell from my hand and it thudded to\\nthe ground. I watched him from behind the tree. He strolled up to the front\\ndoor of a house, unlocked it, and let himself inside.\\nA few seconds later, a light went on in the kitchen. He was standing in\\nprofile, a little way from the window. Only half of the room was visible\\nfrom the street. He was talking to someone I couldn’t see. While they\\ntalked, he opened a bottle of wine. They sat down and ate a meal together.\\nThen I caught a glimpse of his companion. It was a woman. Was it his\\nwife? I couldn’t see her clearly. He put his arm around her and kissed her.\\nSo I wasn’t the only one being betrayed. He had returned home, after\\nkissing my wife, and ate the meal this woman had prepared for him, as if\\nnothing had happened. I knew I couldn’t leave it here—I had to do\\nsomething. But what? Despite my best homicidal fantasies, I wasn’t a\\nmurderer. I couldn’t kill him.\\nI’d have to think of something cleverer than that. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\\nI PLANNED TO HAVE IT out with Alicia first thing in the morning. I intended to\\nmake her admit she had lied to me about the man killing Gabriel and force\\nher to confront the truth.\\nUnfortunately, I never got the chance.\\nYuri was waiting for me in reception. “Theo, I need to talk to you—”\\n“What is it?”\\nI took a closer look at him. His face seemed to have aged overnight; he\\nlooked shrunken, pale, bloodless. Something bad had happened.\\n“There’s been an accident. Alicia—she took an overdose.”\\n“What? Is she—?”\\nYuri shook his head. “She’s still alive, but—”\\n“Thank God—”\\n“But she’s in a coma. It doesn’t look good.”\\n“Where is she?”\\nYuri took me through a series of locked corridors into the intensive care\\nward. Alicia was in a private room. She was hooked up to an ECG machine\\nand a ventilator. Her eyes were closed.\\nChristian was there with another doctor. He looked ashen in contrast to\\nthe emergency-room doctor, who had a deep suntan—she’d obviously just\\ngotten back from holiday. But she didn’t look refreshed. She looked\\nexhausted.\\n“How is Alicia?” I said.\\nThe doctor shook her head. “Not good. We had to induce coma. Her\\nrespiratory system failed.”\\n“What did she take?”\\n“An opioid of some kind. Hydrocodone, probably.”\\nYuri nodded. “There was an empty bottle of pills on the desk in her\\nroom.”\\n“Who found her?” “I did,” Yuri said. “She was on the floor, by the bed. She didn’t seem to\\nbe breathing. I thought she was dead at first.”\\n“Any idea how she got hold of the pills?”\\nYuri glanced at Christian, who shrugged. “We all know there’s a lot of\\ndealing going on in the wards.”\\n“Elif is dealing,” I said.\\nChristian nodded. “Yes, I think so too.”\\nIndira came in. She looked close to tears. She stood by Alicia’s side and\\nwatched her for a moment. “This is going to have a terrible effect on the\\nothers. It always sets the patients back months when this sort of thing\\nhappens.” She sat down and reached for Alicia’s hand and stroked it. I\\nwatched the ventilator rise and fall. There was silence for a moment.\\n“I blame myself,” I said.\\nIndira shook her head. “It’s not your fault, Theo.”\\n“I should have taken better care of her.”\\n“You did your best. You helped her. Which is more than anyone else\\ndid.”\\n“Has anybody told Diomedes?”\\nChristian shook his head. “We’ve not been able to get hold of him yet.”\\n“Did you try his mobile?”\\n“And his home phone. I’ve tried a few times.”\\nYuri frowned. “But—I saw Professor Diomedes earlier. He was here.”\\n“He was?”\\n“Yes, I saw him early this morning. He was at the other end of the\\ncorridor, and he seemed in a rush—at least, I think it was him.”\\n“That’s odd. Well, he must have gone home. Try him again, will you?”\\nYuri nodded. He looked far away somehow; dazed, lost. He seemed to\\nhave taken it badly. I felt sorry for him.\\nChristian’s pager went off, startling him—he quickly left the room,\\nfollowed by Yuri and the doctor.\\nIndira hesitated and spoke in a low voice. “Would you like a moment\\nalone with Alicia?”\\nI nodded, not trusting myself to speak. Indira stood up and squeezed my\\nshoulder for a second. Then she walked out.\\nAlicia and I were alone.\\nI sat down by the bed. I reached out and took Alicia’s arm. A catheter\\nwas attached to the back of her hand. I gently held her hand, stroking her palm and the inside of her wrist. I stroked her wrist with my finger, feeling\\nthe veins under her skin, and the raised, thickened scars from her suicide\\nattempts.\\nSo this was it. This was how it was going to end. Alicia was silent again,\\nand this time her silence would last forever.\\nI wondered what Diomedes would say. I could imagine what Christian\\nwould tell him—Christian would find a way to blame me somehow: the\\nemotions I stirred up in therapy were too much for Alicia to contain—she\\ngot hold of the hydrocodone as an attempt to self-soothe and self-medicate.\\nThe overdose might have been accidental, I could hear Diomedes saying,\\nbut the behavior was suicidal. And that would be that.\\nBut that was not that.\\nSomething had been overlooked. Something significant, something no\\none had noticed—not even Yuri, when he found Alicia unconscious by the\\nbed. An empty pill bottle was on her desk, yes, and a couple of pills were\\non the floor, so of course it was assumed she had taken an overdose.\\nBut here, under my fingertip, on the inside of Alicia’s wrist, was some\\nbruising and a little mark that told a very different story.\\nA pinprick along the vein—a tiny hole left by a hypodermic needle—\\nrevealing the truth: Alicia didn’t swallow a bottle of pills in a suicidal\\ngesture. She was injected with a massive dose of morphine. This wasn’t an\\noverdose.\\nIt was attempted murder. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\\nDIOMEDES TURNED UP half an hour later. He had been in a meeting with the\\nTrust, he said, then got stuck on the underground, delayed by a signal\\nfailure. He asked Yuri to send for me.\\nYuri found me in my office. “Professor Diomedes is here. He’s with\\nStephanie. They’re waiting for you.”\\n“Thanks. I’ll be right there.”\\nI made my way to Diomedes’s office, expecting the worst. A scapegoat\\nwould be needed to take the blame. I’d seen it before, at Broadmoor, in\\ncases of suicide: whichever member of staff was closest to the victim was\\nheld accountable, be it therapist, doctor, or nurse. No doubt Stephanie was\\nbaying for my blood.\\nI knocked on the door and went inside. Stephanie and Diomedes were\\nstanding on either side of the desk. Judging by the tense silence, I’d\\ninterrupted a disagreement.\\nDiomedes spoke first. He was clearly agitated, and his hands flew all\\nover the place. “Terrible business. Terrible. Obviously it couldn’t have\\ncome at a worse time. It gives the Trust the perfect excuse to shut us down.”\\n“I hardly think the Trust is the immediate concern,” Stephanie said. “The\\nsafety of the patients comes first. We need to find out exactly what\\nhappened.” She turned to me. “Indira mentioned you suspected Elif of\\ndealing drugs? That’s how Alicia got hold of the hydrocodone?”\\nI hesitated. “Well, I’ve no proof. It’s something I’ve heard a couple of the\\nnurses talking about. But actually there’s something else I think you should\\nknow—”\\nStephanie interrupted me with a shake of her head. “We know what\\nhappened. It wasn’t Elif.”\\n“No?”\\n“Christian happened to be passing the nurses’ station, and he saw the\\ndrugs cabinet was left wide-open. There was no one in the station. Yuri had left it unlocked. Anyone could have gone in and helped themselves. And\\nChristian saw Alicia lurking around the corner. He wondered what she was\\ndoing there at the time. Now of course it makes sense.”\\n“How fortunate Christian was there to see all this.”\\nMy voice had a sarcastic tone. But Stephanie chose not to pick up on it.\\n“Christian isn’t the only person who’s noticed Yuri’s carelessness. I’ve\\noften felt Yuri is far too relaxed about security. Too friendly with the\\npatients. Too concerned with being popular. I’m surprised something like\\nthis didn’t happen sooner.”\\n“I see.” I did see. I understood now why Stephanie was being cordial to\\nme. It seemed I was off the hook; she had chosen Yuri as the scapegoat.\\n“Yuri always seems so meticulous,” I said, glancing at Diomedes,\\nwondering if he’d intervene. “I really don’t think—”\\nDiomedes shrugged. “My personal opinion is Alicia has always been\\nhighly suicidal. As we know, when someone wants to die, despite your best\\nefforts to protect them, it’s often impossible to prevent it.”\\n“Isn’t that our job?” Stephanie snapped. “To prevent it?”\\n“No.” Diomedes shook his head. “Our job is to help them heal. But we\\nare not God. We do not have the power over life and death. Alicia Berenson\\nwanted to die. At some point she was bound to succeed. Or at least partly\\nsucceed.”\\nI hesitated. It was now or never.\\n“I’m not so sure that’s true,” I said. “I don’t think it was a suicide\\nattempt.”\\n“You think it was an accident?”\\n“No. I don’t think it was an accident.”\\nDiomedes gave me a curious look. “What are you trying to say, Theo?\\nWhat other alternative is there?”\\n“Well, to start with, I don’t believe Yuri gave Alicia the drugs.”\\n“You mean Christian is mistaken?”\\n“No,” I said. “Christian is lying.”\\nDiomedes and Stephanie stared at me, shocked. I went on before they\\ncould recover their power of speech.\\nI quickly told them everything that I had read in Alicia’s diary: that\\nChristian had been treating Alicia privately before Gabriel’s murder; that\\nshe was one of several private patients he saw unofficially, and not only had\\nhe not come forward to testify at the trial, he had pretended not to know Alicia when she was admitted to the Grove. “No wonder he was so against\\nany attempt to get her talking again,” I said. “If she did speak, she would be\\nin a position to expose him.”\\nStephanie stared at me blankly. “But—what are you saying? You can’t\\nseriously be suggesting that he—”\\n“Yes, I am suggesting it. It wasn’t an overdose. It was an attempt to\\nmurder her.”\\n“Where is Alicia’s diary?” Diomedes asked me. “You have it in your\\npossession?”\\nI shook my head. “No, not anymore. I gave it back to Alicia. It must be in\\nher room.”\\n“Then we must retrieve it.” Diomedes turned to Stephanie. “But first, I\\nthink we should call the police. Don’t you?” CHAPTER NINETEEN\\nFROM THEN ON THINGS MOVED FAST.\\nPolice officers swarmed all over the Grove, asking questions, taking\\nphotographs, sealing off Alicia’s studio and her room. The investigation\\nwas led by Chief Inspector Steven Allen, heavyset, bald, with large reading\\nglasses that distorted his eyes, magnifying them, making them seem bigger\\nthan life, bulging with interest and curiosity.\\nAllen listened with careful interest to my story; I told him everything I\\nhad said to Diomedes, and I showed him my supervision notes.\\n“Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Faber.”\\n“Call me Theo.”\\n“I’d like you to make an official statement, please. And I’ll be talking to\\nyou more in due course.”\\n“Yes, certainly.”\\nInspector Allen had commandeered Diomedes’s office. He showed me\\nout. After I made my statement to a junior officer, I hung around in the\\ncorridor, waiting. Soon enough, Christian was led to the door by a police\\nofficer. He looked uneasy, scared—and guilty. I felt satisfied he would soon\\nbe charged.\\nThere was nothing else to do now, except wait. On my way out of the\\nGrove, I passed the goldfish bowl. I glanced inside—and what I saw\\nstopped me in my tracks.\\nElif was being slipped some drugs by Yuri, and he was pocketing some\\ncash.\\nElif charged out and fixed me with her one eye. A look of contempt and\\nhatred.\\n“Elif,” I said.\\n“Fuck off.” She marched off, disappearing around the corner.\\nYuri emerged from the goldfish bowl. As soon as he saw me, his jaw\\ndropped. He stuttered with surprise. “I—I didn’t see you there.” “Obviously not.”\\n“Elif—forgot her medication. I was just giving it to her.”\\n“I see.”\\nSo Yuri was dealing and supplying Elif. I wondered what else he was up\\nto—perhaps I had been a little too hasty to defend him so determinedly to\\nStephanie. I’d better keep an eye on him.\\n“I wanted to ask you,” he said, leading me away from the goldfish bowl.\\n“What should we do about Mr. Martin?”\\n“What do you mean?” I looked at him, surprised. “You mean Jean-Felix\\nMartin? What about him?”\\n“Well, he’s been here for hours. He came this morning to visit Alicia.\\nAnd he’s been waiting since then.”\\n“What? Why didn’t you tell me? You mean he’s been here all this time?”\\n“Sorry, it slipped my mind with everything that happened. He’s in the\\nwaiting room.”\\n“I see. Well, I’d better go and talk to him.”\\nI hurried downstairs to reception, thinking about what I’d just heard.\\nWhat was Jean-Felix doing here? I wondered what he wanted; what it\\nmeant.\\nI went into the waiting room and looked around.\\nBut no one was there. CHAPTER TWENTY\\nI LEFT THE GROVE and lit a cigarette. I heard a man’s voice calling my name.\\nI looked up, expecting it to be Jean-Felix. But it wasn’t him.\\nIt was Max Berenson. He was getting out of a car and charging toward\\nme.\\n“What the fuck?” he shouted. “What happened?” Max’s face was bright\\nred, contorted with anger. “They just called and told me about Alicia. What\\nhappened to her?”\\nI took a step backward. “I think you need to calm down, Mr. Berenson.”\\n“Calm down? My sister-in-law is lying in there in a fucking coma\\nbecause of your negligence—”\\nMax’s hand was clenched in a fist. He raised it. I thought he was going to\\nthrow a punch at me.\\nBut he was interrupted by Tanya. She hurried over, looking just as angry\\nas he was—but angry with Max, not me. “Stop it, Max! For Christ’s sake.\\nAren’t things bad enough? It’s not Theo’s fault!”\\nMax ignored her and turned back to me. His eyes were wild.\\n“Alicia was in your care,” he shouted. “How did you let it happen?\\nHow?”\\nMax’s eyes filled with angry tears. He was making no attempt to disguise\\nhis emotions. He stood there crying. I glanced at Tanya; she obviously knew\\nabout his feelings for Alicia. Tanya looked dismayed and drained. Without\\nanother word, she turned and went back to their car.\\nI wanted to get away from Max as fast as possible. I kept walking.\\nHe kept shouting abuse. I thought he was going to follow, but he didn’t—\\nhe was rooted to the spot, a broken man, calling after me, yelling piteously:\\n“I hold you responsible. My poor Alicia, my girl … my poor Alicia …\\nYou’ll pay for this! You hear me?”\\nMax kept on shouting, but I ignored him. Soon his voice faded into\\nsilence. I was alone. I kept walking. CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\\nI WALKED BACK TO THE HOUSE where Kathy’s lover lived. I stood there for an\\nhour, watching. Eventually the door opened, and he emerged. I watched him\\nleave. Where was he going? To meet Kathy? I hesitated, but decided not to\\nfollow him. Instead I stayed watching the house.\\nI watched his wife through the windows. As I watched, I felt increasingly\\nsure I had to do something to help her. She was me, and I was her: we were\\ntwo innocent victims, deceived and betrayed. She believed this man loved\\nher—but he didn’t.\\nPerhaps I was wrong, assuming she knew nothing about the affair?\\nPerhaps she did know. Perhaps they enjoyed a sexually open relationship\\nand she was equally promiscuous? But somehow I didn’t think so. She\\nlooked innocent, as I had once looked. It was my duty to enlighten her. I\\ncould reveal the truth about the man she was living with, whose bed she\\nshared. I had no choice. I had to help her.\\nOver the next few days, I kept returning. One day, she left the house and\\nwent for a walk. I followed her, keeping my distance. I was worried she saw\\nme at one point, but even if she did, I was just a stranger to her. For the\\nmoment.\\nI went away and made a couple of purchases. I came back again. I stood\\nacross the road, watching the house. I saw her again, standing by the\\nwindow.\\nI didn’t have a plan, as such, just a vague, unformed idea of what I\\nneeded to accomplish. Rather like an inexperienced artist, I knew the result\\nI wanted—without knowing quite how to achieve it. I waited awhile, then\\nwalked up to the house. I tried the gate—it was unlocked. It swung open\\nand I stepped into the garden. I felt a sudden rush of adrenaline. An illicit\\nthrill at being an intruder on someone else’s property.\\nThen I saw the back door opening. I looked for somewhere to hide. I\\nnoticed the little summerhouse across the grass. I raced silently across the lawn and slipped inside. I stood there for a second, catching my breath. My\\nheart was pounding. Had she seen me? I heard her footsteps approaching.\\nToo late to back out now. I reached into my back pocket and took out the\\nblack balaclava I’d bought. I pulled it over my head. I put on a pair of\\ngloves.\\nShe walked in. She was on the phone: “Okay, darling. I’ll see you at\\neight. Yes … I love you too.”\\nShe ended the call and switched on an electric fan. She stood in front of\\nthe fan, her hair blowing in the breeze. She picked up a paintbrush and\\napproached a canvas on an easel. She stood with her back to me. Then she\\ncaught sight of my reflection in the window. I think she saw my knife first.\\nShe stiffened and slowly turned around. Her eyes were wide with fear. We\\nstared at each other in silence.\\nThis was the first time I came face-to-face with Alicia Berenson.\\nThe rest, as they say, is history. PART FIVE\\nIf I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me.\\n—Job 9:20 CHAPTER ONE\\nAlicia Berenson’s Diary\\nFEBRUARY 23\\nTheo just left. I am alone. I’m writing this as fast as I can. I haven’t got\\nmuch time. I’ve got to get this down while I still have the strength.\\nI thought I was crazy at first. It was easier to think I was crazy than believe\\nit was true. But I’m not crazy. I’m not.\\nThat first time I met him in the therapy room, I wasn’t sure—there was\\nsomething familiar about him, but different—I recognized his eyes, not just\\nthe color but the shape. And the same smell of cigarettes and smoky\\naftershave. And the way he formed words, and the rhythm of his speech—\\nbut not the tone of his voice, it seemed different somehow. So I wasn’t sure—\\nbut the next time we met, he gave himself away. He said the same words—\\nthe exact same phrase he’d used at the house, burned into my memory:\\n“I want to help you—I want to help you see clearly.”\\nAs soon as I heard that, something in my brain clicked and the jigsaw came\\ntogether—the picture was complete.\\nIt was him.\\nAnd something in me took over, some kind of wild animal instinct. I wanted\\nto kill him, kill or be killed—I leaped on him and tried to strangle him and\\nscratch his eyes out, bash his skull to pieces on the floor. But I didn’t\\nsucceed in killing him, and they held me down and drugged me and locked\\nme up. And then—after that I lost my nerve. I started to doubt myself again\\n—maybe I’d made a mistake, maybe I was imagining it, maybe it wasn’t\\nhim.\\nHow could it possibly be Theo? What purpose could he have in coming here\\nto taunt me like this? And then I understood. All that bullshit about wanting to help me—that was the sickest part of it. He was getting a kick out of it, he\\nwas getting off on it—that’s why he was here. He had come back to gloat.\\n“I want to help you—I want to help you see clearly.”\\nWell, now I saw. I saw clearly. I wanted him to know that I knew. So I lied\\nabout the way Gabriel died. As I was talking, I could see he knew I was\\nlying. We looked at each other and he saw it—that I had recognized him.\\nAnd there was something in his eyes I’d never seen before. Fear. He was\\nafraid of me—of what I might say. He was scared—of the sound of my\\nvoice.\\nThat’s why he came back a few minutes ago. He didn’t say anything this\\ntime. No more words. He grabbed my wrist and stuck a needle in my vein. I\\ndidn’t struggle. I didn’t fight back. I let him do it. I deserve it—I deserve this\\npunishment. I am guilty—but so is he. That’s why I’m writing this—so he\\nwon’t get away with it. So he will be punished.\\nI’ve got to be quick. I can feel it now—the stuff he injected me with is\\nworking. I’m so drowsy. I want to lie down. I want to sleep.… But no—not\\nyet. I’ve got to stay awake. I’ve got to finish the story. And this time, I’ll tell\\nthe truth.\\nThat night, Theo broke into the house and tied me up—and when Gabriel\\ncame home, Theo knocked him out. At first I thought he’d killed him—but\\nthen I saw Gabriel was breathing. Theo pulled him up and tied him to the\\nchair. He moved it so Gabriel and I were sitting back-to-back, and I\\ncouldn’t see his face.\\n“Please,” I said. “Please don’t hurt him. I’m begging you—I’ll do\\nanything, anything you want.”\\nTheo laughed. I’d come to hate his laugh so much—it was cold, empty.\\nHeartless. “Hurt him?” He shook his head. “I’m going to kill him.”\\nHe meant it. I felt such terror, I lost control of my tears. I wept and pleaded.\\n“I’ll do anything you want, anything—please, please let him live—he\\ndeserves to live. He’s the kindest and the best of men—and I love him, I love\\nhim so much—”\\n“Tell me, Alicia. Tell me about your love for him. Tell me, do you think he\\nloves you?”\\n“He loves me,” I said. I heard the clock ticking in the background. There seemed to be an age\\nbefore he replied. “We’ll see,” he said. His black eyes stared at me for a\\nsecond and I felt consumed by darkness. I was in the presence of a creature\\nthat wasn’t even human. He was evil.\\nHe walked around the chair and faced Gabriel. I turned my head as far as I\\ncould, but I couldn’t see them. There was a horrible dull thud—I flinched as\\nI heard him strike Gabriel across the face. He hit him again and again, until\\nGabriel started spluttering and woke up.\\n“Hello, Gabriel,” he said.\\n“Who the fuck are you?”\\n“I’m a married man. So I know what it’s like to love someone. And I know\\nwhat it’s like to be let down.”\\n“What the fuck are you talking about?”\\n“Only cowards betray the people who love them. Are you a coward,\\nGabriel?”\\n“Fuck you.”\\n“I was going to kill you. But Alicia pleaded for your life. So instead, I’m\\ngoing to give you a choice. Either you die—or Alicia does. You decide.”\\nThe way he spoke was so cool and calm and in control. No emotion.\\nGabriel didn’t reply for a second. He sounded out of breath, like he’d been\\npunched.\\n“No—”\\n“Yes. Alicia dies, or you die. Your choice, Gabriel. Let’s find out how much\\nyou love her. Would you die for her? You have ten seconds to decide.…\\nTen … nine—”\\n“Don’t believe him,” I said. “He’s going to kill us both—I love you—”\\n“—eight … seven—”\\n“I know you love me, Gabriel—”\\n“—six … five—”\\n“You love me—”\\n“—four … three—” “Gabriel, say you love me—”\\n“—two—”\\nAnd then Gabriel spoke. I didn’t recognize his voice at first. Such a tiny\\nvoice, so far away—a little boy’s voice. A small child—with the power of\\nlife and death at his fingertips.\\n“I don’t want to die,” he said.\\nThen there was silence. Everything stopped. Inside my body, every cell\\ndeflated; wilting cells, like dead petals falling from a flower. Jasmine\\nflowers floating to the ground. Can I smell jasmine somewhere? Yes, yes,\\nsweet jasmine—on the windowsill perhaps …\\nTheo stepped away from Gabriel and started talking to me. I found it hard\\nto focus on his words. “You see, Alicia? I knew Gabriel was a coward—\\nfucking my wife behind my back. He destroyed the only happiness I’ve ever\\nhad.” Theo leaned forward, right in my face. “I’m sorry to do this. But\\nquite frankly, now you know the truth … you’re better off dead.”\\nHe raised the gun and pointed it at my head. I shut my eyes. I heard Gabriel\\nscreaming—“Don’t shoot don’t shoot don’t—”\\nA click. And then a gunshot—so loud that it blew away all other sound.\\nThere was silence for a few seconds. I thought I was dead.\\nBut I wasn’t so lucky.\\nI opened my eyes. Theo was still there—pointing the gun at the ceiling. He\\nsmiled. He put his finger to his lips, telling me to keep quiet.\\n“Alicia?” Gabriel shouted. “Alicia?”\\nI could hear Gabriel writhing in his chair, trying to turn around to see what\\nhad happened.\\n“What did you do to her, you bastard? You fucking bastard. Oh, Jesus—”\\nTheo untied my wrists. He dropped the gun to the floor. Then he kissed me,\\never so gently, on the cheek. He walked out, and the front door slammed\\nafter him.\\nGabriel and I were alone. He was sobbing, crying, barely able to form\\nwords. He just kept calling my name, wailing, “Alicia, Alicia—”\\nI remained silent. “Alicia? Fuck, fuck, oh, fuck—”\\nI remained silent.\\n“Alicia, answer me, Alicia—oh, God—”\\nI remained silent. How could I talk? Gabriel had sentenced me to death.\\nThe dead don’t talk.\\nI untied the wire around my ankles. I got up from the chair. I reached down\\nto the floor. My fingers closed around the gun. It was hot and heavy in my\\nhand. I walked around the chair, and I faced Gabriel. Tears were streaming\\ndown his cheeks. His eyes widened.\\n“Alicia? You’re alive—thank God you’re—”\\nI wish I could say I struck a blow for the defeated—that I was standing up\\nfor the betrayed and brokenhearted—that Gabriel had a tyrant’s eyes, my\\nfather’s eyes. But I’m past lying now. The truth is Gabriel had my eyes,\\nsuddenly—and I had his. Somewhere along the way we had swapped\\nplaces.\\nI saw it now. I would never be safe. Never be loved. All my hopes, dashed—\\nall my dreams, shattered—leaving nothing, nothing. My father was right—I\\ndidn’t deserve to live. I was—nothing. That’s what Gabriel did to me.\\nThat’s the truth. I didn’t kill Gabriel. He killed me.\\nAll I did was pull the trigger. CHAPTER TWO\\n“THERE IS NOTHING SO PITIFUL,” Indira said, “as seeing all someone’s\\npossessions in a cardboard box.”\\nI nodded. I looked around the room sadly.\\n“Surprising, really,” Indira went on, “how few things Alicia had. When\\nyou think how much junk the other patients accumulate … All she had were\\nsome books, a few drawings, her clothes.”\\nIndira and I were clearing out Alicia’s room on Stephanie’s instructions.\\n“It’s unlikely she’ll ever wake up,” Stephanie had said, “and quite frankly\\nwe need the bed.” We worked in silence mostly, deciding what to put in\\nstorage and what to throw away. I carefully looked through her belongings.\\nI wanted to make sure there was nothing incriminating—nothing that might\\ntrip me up.\\nI wondered how Alicia had managed to keep her diary hidden and out of\\nsight for so long. Each patient was allowed to bring a small amount of\\npersonal items with them upon admittance to the Grove. Alicia had brought\\na portfolio of sketches, which I presume was how she had smuggled in the\\ndiary. I opened the portfolio and flicked through the drawings—they were\\nmostly unfinished pencil sketches and studies. A few casual lines thrown\\nonto a page, immediately coming to life, brilliantly evocative, capturing an\\nunmistakable likeness.\\nI showed a sketch to Indira. “It’s you.”\\n“What? It’s not.”\\n“It is.”\\n“Is it?” Indira looked delighted and studied it closely. “Do you think so? I\\nnever noticed her drawing me. I wonder when she did it. It’s good, isn’t it?”\\n“Yes, it is. You should keep it.”\\nIndira pulled a face and handed it back. “I couldn’t do that.”\\n“Of course you can. She wouldn’t mind.” I smiled. “No one will ever\\nknow.” “I suppose—I suppose not.” She glanced at the painting upright on the\\nfloor, leaning against the wall—the painting of me and Alicia on the fire\\nescape of the burning building, which had been defaced by Elif.\\n“What about that?” Indira asked. “Will you take it?”\\nI shook my head. “I’ll call Jean-Felix. He can take charge of it.”\\nIndira nodded. “Shame you can’t keep it.”\\nI looked at it for a moment. I didn’t like it. Of all of Alicia’s paintings, it\\nwas the only one I didn’t like. Strange, considering it had me as its subject.\\nI want to be clear—I never thought Alicia would shoot Gabriel. This is\\nan important point. I never intended nor expected her to kill him. All I\\nwanted was to awaken Alicia to the truth about her marriage, as I had been\\nawakened. I intended to show her that Gabriel didn’t love her, that her life\\nwas a lie, their marriage a sham. Only then would she have a chance, as I\\nhad, to build a new life from the rubble; a life based on truth, not lies.\\nI had no idea about Alicia’s history of instability. Had I known, I never\\nwould have pushed things so far. I had no idea she would react like that.\\nAnd when the story was all over the press and Alicia was on trial for\\nmurder, I felt a deep sense of personal responsibility, and the desire to\\nexpiate my guilt and prove that I was not responsible for what had\\nhappened. So I applied for the job at the Grove. I wanted to help her\\nthrough the aftermath of the murder—help her understand what had\\nhappened, work through it—and be free. If you were cynical, you might say\\nI revisited the scene of the crime, so to speak, to cover my tracks. That’s not\\ntrue. Even though I knew the risks of such an endeavor, the real possibility\\nthat I might get caught, that it might end in disaster, I had no choice—\\nbecause of who I am.\\nI am a psychotherapist, remember. Alicia needed help—and only I knew\\nhow to help her.\\nI was nervous she might know me, despite my having worn the mask and\\ndisguised my voice. But Alicia didn’t seem to recognize me, and I was able\\nto play a new part in her life. Then, that night in Cambridge, I finally\\nunderstood what I had unwittingly reenacted, the long-forgotten land mine\\non which I had trodden. Gabriel was the second man to condemn Alicia to\\ndeath; bringing up this original trauma was more than she could bear—\\nwhich is why she picked up the gun and visited her long-awaited revenge\\nnot upon her father, but upon her husband. As I suspected, the murder had\\nmuch older, deeper origins than my actions. But when she lied to me about how Gabriel died, it was obvious Alicia\\nhad recognized me and she was testing me. I was forced to take action, to\\nsilence Alicia forever. I had Christian take the blame—a poetic justice, I\\nfelt. I had no qualms about framing him. Christian had failed Alicia when\\nshe needed him the most; he deserved to be punished.\\nSilencing Alicia wasn’t so easy. Injecting her with morphine was the\\nhardest thing I’ve ever done. That she didn’t die, but is asleep, is better—\\nthis way, I can still visit her every day and sit by her bed and hold her hand.\\nI haven’t lost her.\\n“Are we done?” asked Indira, interrupting my thoughts.\\n“I think so.”\\n“Good. I have to go, I have a patient at twelve.”\\n“Go ahead,” I said.\\n“See you at lunch?”\\n“Yes.”\\nIndira gave my arm a squeeze and left.\\nI looked at my watch. I thought about leaving early, going home. I felt\\nexhausted. I was about to turn off the light and leave when a thought\\noccurred to me and I felt my body stiffen.\\nThe diary. Where was it?\\nMy eyes flickered around the room, neatly packed and boxed up. We’d\\ngone through it all. I had looked at and considered each and every one of\\nher personal items.\\nAnd it wasn’t there.\\nHow could I have been so careless? Indira and her fucking endless inane\\nchatter had distracted me and made me lose focus.\\nWhere was it? It had to be here. Without the diary there was precious\\nlittle evidence to convict Christian. I had to find it.\\nI searched the room, feeling increasingly frantic. I turned the cardboard\\nboxes upside down, scattering their contents on the floor. I rummaged\\nthrough the debris, but it wasn’t there. I tore apart her clothing but found\\nnothing. I ripped open the art portfolio, shaking the sketches to the floor,\\nbut the diary wasn’t among them. Then I went through the cupboards and\\npulled out all the drawers, checking that they were empty, then hurling them\\naside.\\nBut it wasn’t there. CHAPTER THREE\\nJULIAN MCMAHON FROM THE TRUST was waiting for me in reception. He had a\\nbig build, curly ginger hair, and a fondness for phrases such as between you\\nand me or at the end of the day or the bottom line, which frequently popped\\nup in his conversation, often in the same sentence. He was essentially a\\nbenign figure—the friendly face of the Trust. He wanted to have a word\\nwith me before I went home.\\n“I’ve just come from Professor Diomedes. I thought you should know—\\nhe’s resigned.”\\n“Ah. I see.”\\n“He took early retirement. Between you and me, it was either that or face\\nan inquiry into this mess.” Julian shrugged. “I can’t help but feel sorry for\\nhim—not a particularly glorious end to a long and distinguished career. But\\nat least this way he’ll be spared the press and all the hoo-ha. Incidentally, he\\nmentioned you.”\\n“Diomedes?”\\n“Yes. He suggested we give you his job.” Julian winked. “He said you\\nwere the perfect man for it.”\\nI smiled. “That’s very kind.”\\n“Unfortunately, at the end of the day, given what happened to Alicia, and\\nChristian’s arrest, there’s simply no question of keeping the Grove open.\\nWe’re closing it down permanently.”\\n“I can’t say I’m surprised. So in fact there’s no job to be had?”\\n“Well, the bottom line is this—we’re planning to open a new, much more\\ncost-effective psychiatric service here in the next few months. And we’d\\nlike you to consider running it, Theo.”\\nIt was hard to conceal my excitement. I agreed with pleasure. “Between\\nyou and me,” I said, borrowing one of his phrases, “it’s the kind of\\nopportunity that I dream about.” And it was—a chance to actually help people, not just medicate them; help them the way I believe they should be\\nhelped. The way Ruth helped me. The way I tried to help Alicia.\\nThings have worked out well for me—I’d be ungrateful not to\\nacknowledge that.\\nIt seems I’ve gotten everything I wanted. Well, almost.\\n*   *   *\\nLast year, Kathy and I moved out of central London to Surrey—back to\\nwhere I grew up. After my father died, he left me the house; although it\\nremained my mother’s to live in until she died, she decided to give it to us,\\nand she moved into a care facility.\\nKathy and I thought the extra space and a garden would be worth the\\ncommute into London. I thought it would be good for us. We promised\\nourselves we would transform the house and made plans to redecorate and\\nexorcise. But nearly a year since we moved in, the place remains\\nunfinished, half-decorated, the pictures and convex mirror we bought in\\nPortobello Market still propped up against unpainted walls. It remains very\\nmuch the house I grew up in. But I don’t mind the way I thought I would. In\\nfact, I feel quite at home, which is ironic.\\nI arrived at the house and let myself in. I quickly took off my coat—it\\nwas sweltering, like a greenhouse. I turned down the thermostat in the\\nhallway. Kathy loves being hot, while I much prefer being cold, so\\ntemperature is one of our little battlegrounds. I could hear the TV from the\\nhallway. Kathy seems to watch a lot of TV these days. A never-ending\\nsound track of garbage that underscores our life in this house.\\nI found her in the living room, curled up on the sofa. She had a giant bag\\nof prawn cocktail crisps on her lap and was fishing them out with sticky red\\nfingers and shoveling them into her mouth. She’s always eating crap like\\nthat; it’s not surprising she’s gained weight recently. She hasn’t been\\nworking much in the past couple of years, and she’s become quite\\nwithdrawn, depressed even. Her doctor wanted to put her on\\nantidepressants, but I discouraged it. Instead I advocated her getting a\\ntherapist and talking through her feelings; I even offered to find her a shrink\\nmyself. But Kathy doesn’t want to talk, it seems.\\nSometimes I catch her looking at me strangely—and wonder what she’s\\nthinking. Is she trying to summon up the courage to tell me about Gabriel and the affair? But she doesn’t say a word. She just sits in silence, the way\\nAlicia used to. I wish I could help her—but I can’t seem to reach her.\\nThat’s the terrible irony: I did all this to keep Kathy—and I’ve lost her\\nanyway.\\nI perched on the armrest and watched her a moment. “A patient of mine\\ntook an overdose. She’s in a coma.” No reaction. “It looks as though\\nanother member of the staff may have administered the overdose\\ndeliberately. A colleague.” No reaction. “Are you listening to me?”\\nKathy gave a brief shrug. “I don’t know what to say.”\\n“Some sympathy might be nice.”\\n“For who? For you?”\\n“For her. I’ve been seeing her for a while, in individual therapy. Her\\nname is Alicia Berenson.” I glanced at Kathy as I said this.\\nShe didn’t react. Not even a flicker of emotion.\\n“She’s famous, or infamous. Everyone was talking about her a few years\\nago. She killed her husband … remember?”\\n“No, not really.” Kathy shrugged and changed the channel.\\nSo we continue our game of “let’s pretend.”\\nI seem to do a lot of pretending, these days—for a lot of people,\\nincluding myself. Which is why I’m writing this, I suppose. An attempt to\\nbypass my monstrous ego and access the truth about myself—if that’s\\npossible.\\nI needed a drink. I went into the kitchen and poured myself a shot of\\nvodka from the freezer. It burned my throat as I swallowed it. I poured\\nanother.\\nI wondered what Ruth would say if I went to find her again—as I did six\\nyears ago—and confessed all this to her? But I knew it was impossible.\\nThat I was altogether a different creature now, a guiltier thing, less capable\\nof honesty. How could I sit opposite that frail old lady and look into those\\nwatery blue eyes that held me safe for so long—and gave me nothing but\\ndecency, kindness, truth—and reveal how foul I am, how cruel, how\\nvengeful and perverse, how unworthy I am of Ruth and everything she tried\\nto do for me? How could I tell her that I have destroyed three lives? That I\\nhave no moral code, that I’m capable of the worst kind of acts without\\nremorse, and my only concern is for my own skin?\\nEven worse than the shock or repulsion, or possibly even fear, in Ruth’s\\neyes as I told her this would be the look of sadness, disappointment, and self-reproach. Because not only had I let her down, I know she would be\\nthinking she had let me down—and not just me, but the talking cure itself.\\nFor no therapist ever had a better shot at it than Ruth—she had years to\\nwork with someone who was damaged, yes, but so young, just a boy, and so\\nwilling to change, to get better, to heal. Yet, despite hundreds of hours of\\npsychotherapy, talking and listening and analyzing, she was unable to save\\nhis soul.\\nThe doorbell rang, rousing me from my thoughts. It wasn’t a common\\noccurrence, an evening visitor, not since we moved to Surrey; I couldn’t\\neven remember the last time we’d had friends over.\\n“Are you expecting someone?” I called out, but there was no reply. Kathy\\nprobably couldn’t hear me over the TV.\\nI went to the front door and opened it. To my surprise, it was Chief\\nInspector Allen. He was wrapped up in a scarf and coat, and his cheeks\\nwere flushed.\\n“Good evening, Mr. Faber.”\\n“Inspector Allen? What are you doing here?”\\n“I happened to be in the neighborhood and thought I’d pop in. A couple\\nof developments I wanted to tell you about. Is now convenient?”\\nI hesitated. “To be honest, I’m just about to cook dinner, so—”\\n“This won’t take long.”\\nAllen smiled. He clearly wasn’t going to take no for an answer, so I\\nstepped aside and let him enter. He looked happy to be inside. He pulled off\\nhis gloves and his coat. “It’s getting bloody cold out there. Cold enough to\\nsnow, I’d bet.” His glasses had steamed up and he took them off and wiped\\nthem with his handkerchief.\\n“I’m afraid it’s rather warm in here,” I said.\\n“Not for me. Can’t be too warm for my liking.”\\n“You’d get on with my wife.”\\nRight on cue, Kathy appeared in the hallway. She looked from me to the\\ninspector quizzically. “What’s going on?”\\n“Kathy, this is Chief Inspector Allen. He’s in charge of the investigation\\nabout the patient I mentioned.”\\n“Good evening, Mrs. Faber.”\\n“Inspector Allen wants to talk to me about something. We won’t be long.\\nGo upstairs and have your bath, and I’ll call you when dinner’s ready.” I\\nnodded at the inspector to go into the kitchen. “After you.” Inspector Allen glanced at Kathy again before he turned and went into\\nthe kitchen. I followed, leaving Kathy lingering in the hallway, before I\\nheard her footsteps slowly going upstairs.\\n“Can I get you something to drink?”\\n“Thank you. That’s very kind. A cup of tea would be lovely.” I saw his\\neyes go to the bottle of vodka on the counter.\\nI smiled. “Or something stronger if you prefer?”\\n“No, thank you. A cup of tea suits me just fine.”\\n“How do you take it?”\\n“Strong, please. Just enough milk to color it. No sugar, I’m trying to give\\nit up.”\\nAs he spoke, my mind drifted—wondering what he was doing here, and\\nif I should be nervous. His manner was so genial it was hard not to feel\\nsafe. Besides, there was nothing that could trip me up, was there?\\nI switched on the kettle and turned to face him.\\n“So, Inspector? What was it you wanted to talk to me about?”\\n“Well, about Mr. Martin, mainly.”\\n“Jean-Felix? Really?” That surprised me. “What about him?”\\n“Well, he came to the Grove to collect Alicia’s art materials, and we got\\ntalking about one thing and another. Interesting man, Mr. Martin. He’s\\nplanning a retrospective of Alicia’s work. He seems to think now is a good\\ntime to reevaluate her as an artist. Given all the publicity, I daresay he’s\\nright.” Allen gave me an appraising look. “You might want to write about\\nher, sir. I’m sure there’ll be interest in a book, or something like that.”\\n“I hadn’t considered it.… What exactly has Jean-Felix’s retrospective got\\nto do with me, Inspector?”\\n“Well, Mr. Martin was particularly excited to see the new painting—he\\ndidn’t seem concerned that Elif defaced it. He said it added a special quality\\nto it—I can’t remember the exact words he used—I don’t know much about\\nart myself. Do you?”\\n“Not really.” I wondered how long it was going to take the inspector to\\nget to the point, and why I was feeling increasingly uneasy.\\n“Anyway, Mr. Martin was admiring the picture. And he picked it up to\\nlook at it more closely, and there it was.”\\n“What was?”\\n“This.” The inspector pulled out something from inside his jacket. I recognized it\\nat once.\\nThe diary.\\nThe kettle boiled and a shriek filled the air. I switched it off and poured\\nsome boiling water into the mug. I stirred it and noticed my hand was\\ntrembling slightly.\\n“Oh, good. I wondered where it was.”\\n“Wedged in the back of the painting, in the top-left corner of the frame. It\\nwas jammed in tight.”\\nSo that’s where she hid it, I thought. The back of the painting that I hated.\\nThe one place I didn’t look.\\nThe inspector stroked the creased, faded black cover and smiled. He\\nopened it and looked through the pages. “Fascinating. The arrows, the\\nconfusion.”\\nI nodded. “A portrait of a disturbed mind.”\\nInspector Allen flicked through the pages to the end. He started reading\\nfrom it aloud:\\n“‘… he was scared—of the sound of my voice.… He grabbed my wrist\\nand stuck a needle in my vein.’”\\nI felt a sudden rising panic. I didn’t know those words. I hadn’t read that\\nentry. It was the incriminating evidence I had been looking for—and it was\\nin the wrong hands. I wanted to snatch the diary from Allen and tear out the\\npages—but I couldn’t move. I was trapped. I started stammering—\\n“I—I really think it’s better if I—”\\nI spoke too nervously, and he heard the fear in my voice. “Yes?”\\n“Nothing.”\\nI made no further attempt to stop him. Any action I took would be\\nviewed as incriminating anyway. There was no way out. And the strangest\\nthing is, I felt relieved.\\n“You know, I don’t believe you happened to be in my neighborhood at\\nall, Inspector.” I handed him his tea.\\n“Ah. No, you’re quite right. I thought it best not to announce the\\nintention of my visit on the doorstep. But the fact is, this puts things in\\nrather a different light.”\\n“I’m curious to hear it,” I heard myself saying. “Will you read it aloud?”\\n“Very well.”\\nI felt strangely calm as I sat in the chair by the window. He cleared his throat and began. “‘Theo just left. I am alone. I’m writing\\nthis as fast as I can.…’”\\nAs I listened, I looked up at the white clouds drifting past. Finally, they\\nhad opened—it had started to snow—snowflakes were falling outside. I\\nopened the window and reached out my hand. I caught a snowflake. I\\nwatched it disappear, vanish from my fingertip. I smiled.\\nAnd I went to catch another one. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nI’m hugely indebted to my agent, Sam Copeland, for making all this\\nhappen.

Thought reﬂects perception and\\nperception leads to both behaviour and self-identity. In that sense\\n‘we’ are what we think. But who or what is doing the thinking and is\\nthinking the only route to perception? Clearly, as we shall see, ‘we’\\nare not always the source of ‘our’ perception, indeed with regard to\\nhumanity as a whole this is rarely the case; and thinking is far from\\nthe only means of perception. Thought is the village idiot compared\\nwith other expressions of consciousness that we all have the\\npotential to access and tap into. This has to be true when we are\\nthose other expressions of consciousness which are inﬁnite in nature.\\nWe have forgo\\x00en this, or, more to the point, been manipulated to\\nforget.\\nThese are not just the esoteric musings of the navel. The whole\\nfoundation of human control and oppression is control of\\nperception. Once perception is hĳacked then so is behaviour which\\nis dictated by perception. Collective perception becomes collective\\nbehaviour and collective behaviour is what we call human society.\\nPerception is all and those behind human control know that which is why perception is the target 24/7 of the psychopathic manipulators\\nthat I call the Global Cult. They know that if they dictate perception\\nthey will dictate behaviour and collectively dictate the nature of\\nhuman society. They are further aware that perception is formed\\nfrom information received and if they control the circulation of\\ninformation they will to a vast extent direct human behaviour.\\nCensorship of information and opinion has become globally Nazi-\\nlike in recent years and never more blatantly than since the illusory\\n‘virus pandemic’ was triggered out of China in 2019 and across the\\nworld in 2020. Why have billions submi\\x00ed to house arrest and\\naccepted fascistic societies in a way they would have never believed\\npossible? Those controlling the information spewing from\\ngovernment, mainstream media and Silicon Valley (all controlled by\\nthe same Global Cult networks) told them they were in danger from\\na ‘deadly virus’ and only by submi\\x00ing to house arrest and\\nconceding their most basic of freedoms could they and their families\\nbe protected. This monumental and provable lie became the\\nperception of the billions and therefore the behaviour of the billions. In\\nthose few words you have the whole structure and modus operandi\\nof human control. Fear is a perception – False Emotion Appearing\\nReal – and fear is the currency of control. In short … get them by the\\nballs (or give them the impression that you have) and their hearts\\nand minds will follow. Nothing grips the dangly bits and freezes the\\nrear-end more comprehensively than fear.\\nWorld number 1\\nThere are two ‘worlds’ in what appears to be one ‘world’ and the\\nprime diﬀerence between them is knowledge. First we have the mass\\nof human society in which the population is maintained in coldly-\\ncalculated ignorance through control of information and the\\n‘education’ (indoctrination) system. That’s all you really need to\\ncontrol to enslave billions in a perceptual delusion in which what are\\nperceived to be their thoughts and opinions are ever-repeated\\nmantras that the system has been downloading all their lives\\nthrough ‘education’, media, science, medicine, politics and academia in which the personnel and advocates are themselves\\noverwhelmingly the perceptual products of the same repetition.\\nTeachers and academics in general are processed by the same\\nprogramming machine as everyone else, but unlike the great\\nmajority they never leave the ‘education’ program. It gripped them\\nas students and continues to grip them as programmers of\\nsubsequent generations of students. The programmed become the\\nprogrammers – the programmed programmers. The same can\\nlargely be said for scientists, doctors and politicians and not least\\nbecause as the American writer Upton Sinclair said: ‘It is diﬃcult to\\nget a man to understand something when his salary depends upon\\nhis not understanding it.’ If your career and income depend on\\nthinking the way the system demands then you will – bar a few free-\\nminded exceptions – concede your mind to the Perceptual\\nMainframe that I call the Postage Stamp Consensus. This is a tiny\\nband of perceived knowledge and possibility ‘taught’ (downloaded)\\nin the schools and universities, pounded out by the mainstream\\nmedia and on which all government policy is founded. Try thinking,\\nand especially speaking and acting, outside of the ‘box’ of consensus\\nand see what that does for your career in the Mainstream Everything\\nwhich bullies, harasses, intimidates and ridicules the population into\\ncompliance. Here we have the simple structure which enslaves most\\nof humanity in a perceptual prison cell for an entire lifetime and I’ll\\ngo deeper into this process shortly. Most of what humanity is taught\\nas fact is nothing more than programmed belief. American science\\nﬁction author Frank Herbert was right when he said: ‘Belief can be\\nmanipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous.’ In the ‘Covid’ age\\nbelief is promoted and knowledge is censored. It was always so, but\\nnever to the extreme of today.\\nWorld number 2\\nA ‘number 2’ is slang for ‘doing a poo’ and how appropriate that is\\nwhen this other ‘world’ is doing just that on humanity every minute\\nof every day. World number 2 is a global network of secret societies\\nand semi-secret groups dictating the direction of society via governments, corporations and authorities of every kind. I have\\nspent more than 30 years uncovering and exposing this network that\\nI call the Global Cult and knowing its agenda is what has made my\\nbooks so accurate in predicting current and past events. Secret\\nsocieties are secret for a reason. They want to keep their hoarded\\nknowledge to themselves and their chosen initiates and to hide it\\nfrom the population which they seek through ignorance to control\\nand subdue. The whole foundation of the division between World 1\\nand World 2 is knowledge. What number 1 knows number 2 must not.\\nKnowledge they have worked so hard to keep secret includes (a) the\\nagenda to enslave humanity in a centrally-controlled global\\ndictatorship, and (b) the nature of reality and life itself. The la\\x00er (b)\\nmust be suppressed to allow the former (a) to prevail as I shall be\\nexplaining. The way the Cult manipulates and interacts with the\\npopulation can be likened to a spider’s web. The ‘spider’ sits at the\\ncentre in the shadows and imposes its will through the web with\\neach strand represented in World number 2 by a secret society,\\nsatanic or semi-secret group, and in World number 1 – the world of\\nthe seen – by governments, agencies of government, law\\nenforcement, corporations, the banking system, media\\nconglomerates and Silicon Valley (Fig 1 overleaf). The spider and the\\nweb connect and coordinate all these organisations to pursue the\\nsame global outcome while the population sees them as individual\\nentities working randomly and independently. At the level of the\\nweb governments are the banking system are the corporations are the\\nmedia are Silicon Valley are the World Health Organization working\\nfrom their inner cores as one unit. Apparently unconnected\\ncountries, corporations, institutions, organisations and people are on\\nthe same team pursuing the same global outcome. Strands in the web\\nimmediately around the spider are the most secretive and exclusive\\nsecret societies and their membership is emphatically restricted to\\nthe Cult inner-circle emerging through the generations from\\nparticular bloodlines for reasons I will come to. At the core of the\\ncore you would get them in a single room. That’s how many people\\nare dictating the direction of human society and its transformation through the ‘Covid’ hoax and other means. As the web expands out\\nfrom the spider we meet the secret societies that many people will be\\naware of – the Freemasons, Knights Templar, Knights of Malta, Opus\\nDei, the inner sanctum of the Jesuit Order, and such like. Note how\\nmany are connected to the Church of Rome and there is a reason for\\nthat. The Roman Church was established as a revamp, a rebranding,\\nof the relocated ‘Church’ of Babylon and the Cult imposing global\\ntyranny today can be tracked back to Babylon and Sumer in what is\\nnow Iraq.\\nFigure 1: The global web through which the few control the many. (Image Neil Hague.)\\nInner levels of the web operate in the unseen away from the public\\neye and then we have what I call the cusp organisations located at\\nthe point where the hidden meets the seen. They include a series of\\nsatellite organisations answering to a secret society founded in\\nLondon in the late 19th century called the Round Table and among\\nthem are the Royal Institute of International Aﬀairs (UK, founded in\\n1920); Council on Foreign Relations (US, 1921); Bilderberg Group\\n(worldwide, 1954); Trilateral Commission (US/worldwide, 1972); and\\nthe Club of Rome (worldwide, 1968) which was created to exploit\\nenvironmental concerns to justify the centralisation of global power\\nto ‘save the planet’. The Club of Rome instigated with others the\\nhuman-caused climate change hoax which has led to all the ‘green new deals’ demanding that very centralisation of control. Cusp\\norganisations, which include endless ‘think tanks’ all over the world,\\nare designed to coordinate a single global policy between political\\nand business leaders, intelligence personnel, media organisations\\nand anyone who can inﬂuence the direction of policy in their own\\nsphere of operation. Major players and regular a\\x00enders will know\\nwhat is happening – or some of it – while others come and go and\\nare kept overwhelmingly in the dark about the big picture. I refer to\\nthese cusp groupings as semi-secret in that they can be publicly\\nidentiﬁed, but what goes on at the inner-core is kept very much ‘in\\nhouse’ even from most of their members and participants through a\\nﬁercely-imposed system of compartmentalisation. Only let them\\nknow what they need to know to serve your interests and no more.\\nThe structure of secret societies serves as a perfect example of this\\nprinciple. Most Freemasons never get higher than the bo\\x00om three\\nlevels of ‘degree’ (degree of knowledge) when there are 33 oﬃcial\\ndegrees of the Sco\\x00ish Rite. Initiates only qualify for the next higher\\n‘compartment’ or degree if those at that level choose to allow them.\\nKnowledge can be carefully assigned only to those considered ‘safe’.\\nI went to my local Freemason’s lodge a few years ago when they\\nwere having an ‘open day’ to show how cuddly they were and when\\nI cha\\x00ed to some of them I was astonished at how li\\x00le the rank and\\nﬁle knew even about the most ubiquitous symbols they use. The\\nmushroom technique – keep them in the dark and feed them bullshit\\n– applies to most people in the web as well as the population as a\\nwhole. Sub-divisions of the web mirror in theme and structure\\ntransnational corporations which have a headquarters somewhere in\\nthe world dictating to all their subsidiaries in diﬀerent countries.\\nSubsidiaries operate in their methodology and branding to the same\\ncentrally-dictated plan and policy in pursuit of particular ends. The\\nCult web functions in the same way. Each country has its own web\\nas a subsidiary of the global one. They consist of networks of secret\\nsocieties, semi-secret groups and bloodline families and their job is\\nto impose the will of the spider and the global web in their particular\\ncountry. Subsidiary networks control and manipulate the national\\npolitical system, ﬁnance, corporations, media, medicine, etc. to ensure that they follow the globally-dictated Cult agenda. These\\nnetworks were the means through which the ‘Covid’ hoax could be\\nplayed out with almost every country responding in the same way.\\nThe ‘Yessir’ pyramid\\nCompartmentalisation is the key to understanding how a tiny few\\ncan dictate the lives of billions when combined with a top-down\\nsequence of imposition and acquiescence. The inner core of the Cult\\nsits at the peak of the pyramidal hierarchy of human society (Fig 2\\noverleaf). It imposes its will – its agenda for the world – on the level\\nimmediately below which acquiesces to that imposition. This level\\nthen imposes the Cult will on the level below them which acquiesces\\nand imposes on the next level. Very quickly we meet levels in the\\nhierarchy that have no idea there even is a Cult, but the sequence of\\nimposition and acquiescence continues down the pyramid in just the\\nsame way. ‘I don’t know why we are doing this but the order came\\nfrom “on-high” and so we be\\x00er just do it.’ Alfred Lord Tennyson\\nsaid of the cannon fodder levels in his poem The Charge of the Light\\nBrigade: ‘Theirs not to reason why; theirs but to do and die.’ The next\\nline says that ‘into the valley of death rode the six hundred’ and they\\ndied because they obeyed without question what their perceived\\n‘superiors’ told them to do. In the same way the population\\ncapitulated to ‘Covid’. The whole hierarchical pyramid functions\\nlike this to allow the very few to direct the enormous many.\\nEventually imposition-acquiescence-imposition-acquiescence comes\\ndown to the mass of the population at the foot of the pyramid. If\\nthey acquiesce to those levels of the hierarchy imposing on them\\n(governments/law enforcement/doctors/media) a circuit is\\ncompleted between the population and the handful of super-\\npsychopaths in the Cult inner core at the top of the pyramid.\\nWithout a circuit-breaking refusal to obey, the sequence of\\nimposition and acquiescence allows a staggeringly few people to\\nimpose their will upon the entirety of humankind. We are looking at\\nthe very sequence that has subjugated billions since the start of 2020.\\nOur freedom has not been taken from us. Humanity has given it away. Fascists do not impose fascism because there are not enough\\nof them. Fascism is imposed by the population acquiescing to\\nfascism. Put another way allowing their perceptions to be\\nprogrammed to the extent that leads to the population giving their\\nfreedom away by giving their perceptions – their mind – away. If this\\ncircuit is not broken by humanity ceasing to cooperate with their\\nown enslavement then nothing can change. For that to happen\\npeople have to critically think and see through the lies and window\\ndressing and then summon the backbone to act upon what they see.\\nThe Cult spends its days working to stop either happening and its\\nmethodology is systematic and highly detailed, but it can be\\novercome and that is what this book is all about.\\nFigure 2: The simple sequence of imposition and compliance that allows a handful of people\\nat the peak of the pyramid to dictate the lives of billions.\\nThe Life Program\\nOkay, back to world number 1 or the world of the ‘masses’. Observe\\nthe process of what we call ‘life’ and it is a perceptual download\\nfrom cradle to grave. The Cult has created a global structure in\\nwhich perception can be programmed and the program continually\\ntopped-up with what appears to be constant conﬁrmation that the\\nprogram is indeed true reality. The important word here is ‘appears’. This is the structure, the ﬂy-trap, the Postage Stamp Consensus or\\nPerceptual Mainframe, which represents that incredibly narrow\\nband of perceived possibility delivered by the ‘education’ system,\\nmainstream media, science and medicine. From the earliest age the\\ndownload begins with parents who have themselves succumbed to\\nthe very programming their children are about to go through. Most\\nparents don’t do this out of malevolence and mostly it is quite the\\nopposite. They do what they believe is best for their children and\\nthat is what the program has told them is best. Within three or four\\nyears comes the major transition from parental programming to full-\\nblown state (Cult) programming in school, college and university\\nwhere perceptually-programmed teachers and academics pass on\\ntheir programming to the next generations. Teachers who resist are\\nsoon marginalised and their careers ended while children who resist\\nare called a problem child for whom Ritalin may need to be\\nprescribed. A few years a\\x00er entering the ‘world’ children are under\\nthe control of authority ﬁgures representing the state telling them\\nwhen they have to be there, when they can leave and when they can\\nspeak, eat, even go to the toilet. This is calculated preparation for a\\nlifetime of obeying authority in all its forms. Reﬂex-action fear of\\nauthority is instilled by authority from the start. Children soon learn\\nthe carrot and stick consequences of obeying or defying authority\\nwhich is underpinned daily for the rest of their life. Fortunately I\\ndaydreamed through this crap and never obeyed authority simply\\nbecause it told me to. This approach to my alleged ‘be\\x00ers’ continues\\nto this day. There can be consequences of pursuing open-minded\\nfreedom in a world of closed-minded conformity. I spent a lot of time\\nin school corridors a\\x00er being ejected from the classroom for not\\ntaking some of it seriously and now I spend a lot of time being\\nejected from Facebook, YouTube and Twi\\x00er. But I can tell you that\\nbeing true to yourself and not compromising your self-respect is far\\nmore exhilarating than bowing to authority for authority’s sake. You\\ndon’t have to be a sheep to the shepherd (authority) and the sheep\\ndog (fear of not obeying authority). The perceptual download continues throughout the formative\\nyears in school, college and university while script-reading\\n‘teachers’, ‘academics’ ‘scientists’, ‘doctors’ and ‘journalists’ insist\\nthat ongoing generations must be as programmed as they are.\\nAccept the program or you will not pass your ‘exams’ which conﬁrm\\nyour ‘degree’ of programming. It is tragic to think that many parents\\npressure their oﬀspring to work hard at school to download the\\nprogram and qualify for the next stage at college and university. The\\nlate, great, American comedian George Carlin said: ‘Here’s a bumper\\nsticker I’d like to see: We are proud parents of a child who has\\nresisted his teachers’ a\\x00empts to break his spirit and bend him to the\\nwill of his corporate masters.’ Well, the best of luck ﬁnding many of\\nthose, George. Then comes the moment to leave the formal\\nprogramming years in academia and enter the ‘adult’ world of work.\\nThere you meet others in your chosen or prescribed arena who went\\nthrough the same Postage Stamp Consensus program before you\\ndid. There is therefore overwhelming agreement between almost\\neveryone on the basic foundations of Postage Stamp reality and the\\nrejection, even contempt, of the few who have a mind of their own\\nand are prepared to use it. This has two major eﬀects. Firstly, the\\nconsensus conﬁrms to the programmed that their download is really\\nhow things are. I mean, everyone knows that, right? Secondly, the\\narrogance and ignorance of Postage Stamp adherents ensure that\\nanyone questioning the program will have unpleasant consequences\\nfor seeking their own truth and not picking their perceptions from\\nthe shelf marked: ‘Things you must believe without question and if\\nyou don’t you’re a dangerous lunatic conspiracy theorist and a\\nharebrained nu\\x00er’.\\nEvery government, agency and corporation is founded on the\\nsame Postage Stamp prison cell and you can see why so many\\npeople believe the same thing while calling it their own ‘opinion’.\\nFusion of governments and corporations in pursuit of the same\\nagenda was the deﬁnition of fascism described by Italian dictator\\nBenito Mussolini. The pressure to conform to perceptual norms\\ndownloaded for a lifetime is incessant and inﬁltrates society right down to family groups that become censors and condemners of their\\nown ‘black sheep’ for not, ironically, being sheep. We have seen an\\nexplosion of that in the ‘Covid’ era. Cult-owned global media\\nunleashes its propaganda all day every day in support of the Postage\\nStamp and targets with abuse and ridicule anyone in the public eye\\nwho won’t bend their mind to the will of the tyranny. Any response\\nto this is denied (certainly in my case). They don’t want to give a\\nplatform to expose oﬃcial lies. Cult-owned-and-created Internet\\ngiants like Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twi\\x00er delete you for\\nhaving an unapproved opinion. Facebook boasts that its AI censors\\ndelete 97-percent of ‘hate speech’ before anyone even reports it.\\nMuch of that ‘hate speech’ will simply be an opinion that Facebook\\nand its masters don’t want people to see. Such perceptual oppression\\nis widely known as fascism. Even Facebook executive Benny\\nThomas, a ‘CEO Global Planning Lead’, said in comments secretly\\nrecorded by investigative journalism operation Project Veritas that\\nFacebook is ‘too powerful’ and should be broken up:\\nI mean, no king in history has been the ruler of two billion people, but Mark Zuckerberg is …\\nAnd he’s 36. That’s too much for a 36-year-old ... You should not have power over two billion\\npeople. I just think that’s wrong.\\nThomas said Facebook-owned platforms like Instagram, Oculus, and\\nWhatsApp needed to be separate companies. ‘It’s too much power\\nwhen they’re all one together’. That’s the way the Cult likes it,\\nhowever. We have an executive of a Cult organisation in Benny\\nThomas that doesn’t know there is a Cult such is the\\ncompartmentalisation. Thomas said that Facebook and Google ‘are\\nno longer companies, they’re countries’. Actually they are more\\npowerful than countries on the basis that if you control information\\nyou control perception and control human society.\\nI love my oppressor\\nAnother expression of this psychological trickery is for those who\\nrealise they are being pressured into compliance to eventually •\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nconvince themselves to believe the oﬃcial narratives to protect their\\nself-respect from accepting the truth that they have succumbed to\\nmeek and subservient compliance. Such people become some of the\\nmost vehement defenders of the system. You can see them\\neverywhere screaming abuse at those who prefer to think for\\nthemselves and by doing so reminding the compliers of their own\\ncapitulation to conformity. ‘You are talking dangerous nonsense you\\nCovidiot!!’ Are you trying to convince me or yourself? It is a potent\\nform of Stockholm syndrome which is deﬁned as: ‘A psychological\\ncondition that occurs when a victim of abuse identiﬁes and a\\x00aches,\\nor bonds, positively with their abuser.’ An example is hostages\\nbonding and even ‘falling in love’ with their kidnappers. The\\nsyndrome has been observed in domestic violence, abused children,\\nconcentration camp inmates, prisoners of war and many and various\\nSatanic cults. These are some traits of Stockholm syndrome listed at\\ngoodtherapy.org:\\n \\nPositive regard towards perpetrators of abuse or captor [see\\n‘Covid’].\\nFailure to cooperate with police and other government authorities\\nwhen it comes to holding perpetrators of abuse or kidnapping\\naccountable [or in the case of ‘Covid’ cooperating with the police\\nto enforce and defend their captors’ demands].\\nLi\\x00le or no eﬀort to escape [see ‘Covid’].\\nBelief in the goodness of the perpetrators or kidnappers [see\\n‘Covid’].\\nAppeasement of captors. This is a manipulative strategy for\\nmaintaining one’s safety. As victims get rewarded – perhaps with\\nless abuse or even with life itself – their appeasing behaviours are\\nreinforced [see ‘Covid’].\\nLearned helplessness. This can be akin to ‘if you can’t beat ‘em,\\njoin ‘em’. As the victims fail to escape the abuse or captivity, they\\nmay start giving up and soon realize it’s just easier for everyone if\\nthey acquiesce all their power to their captors [see ‘Covid’]. •\\n•\\nFeelings of pity toward the abusers, believing they are actually\\nvictims themselves. Because of this, victims may go on a crusade\\nor mission to ‘save’ [protect] their abuser [see the venom\\nunleashed on those challenging the oﬃcial ‘Covid’ narrative].\\nUnwillingness to learn to detach from their perpetrators and heal.\\nIn essence, victims may tend to be less loyal to themselves than to\\ntheir abuser [ definitely see ‘Covid’].\\nPonder on those traits and compare them with the behaviour of\\ngreat swathes of the global population who have defended\\ngovernments and authorities which have spent every minute\\ndestroying their lives and livelihoods and those of their children and\\ngrandchildren since early 2020 with fascistic lockdowns, house arrest\\nand employment deletion to ‘protect’ them from a ‘deadly virus’ that\\ntheir abusers’ perceptually created to bring about this very outcome.\\nWe are looking at mass Stockholm syndrome. All those that agree to\\nconcede their freedom will believe those perceptions are originating\\nin their own independent ‘mind’ when in fact by conceding their\\nreality to Stockholm syndrome they have by deﬁnition conceded any\\nindependence of mind. Listen to the ‘opinions’ of the acquiescing\\nmasses in this ‘Covid’ era and what gushes forth is the repetition of\\nthe oﬃcial version of everything delivered unprocessed, unﬁltered\\nand unquestioned. The whole programming dynamic works this\\nway. I must be free because I’m told that I am and so I think that I\\nam.\\nYou can see what I mean with the chapter theme of ‘I’m thinking –\\nOh, but are you?’ The great majority are not thinking, let alone for\\nthemselves. They are repeating what authority has told them to\\nbelieve which allows them to be controlled. Weaving through this\\nmentality is the fear that the ‘conspiracy theorists’ are right and this\\nagain explains the o\\x00en hysterical abuse that ensues when you dare\\nto contest the oﬃcial narrative of anything. Denial is the mechanism\\nof hiding from yourself what you don’t want to be true. Telling\\npeople what they want to hear is easy, but it’s an inﬁnitely greater\\nchallenge to tell them what they would rather not be happening. One is akin to pushing against an open door while the other is met\\nwith vehement resistance no ma\\x00er what the scale of evidence. I\\ndon’t want it to be true so I’ll convince myself that it’s not. Examples\\nare everywhere from the denial that a partner is cheating despite all\\nthe signs to the reﬂex-action rejection of any idea that world events\\nin which country a\\x00er country act in exactly the same way are\\ncentrally coordinated. To accept the la\\x00er is to accept that a force of\\nunspeakable evil is working to destroy your life and the lives of your\\nchildren with nothing too horriﬁc to achieve that end. Who the heck\\nwants that to be true? But if we don’t face reality the end is duly\\nachieved and the consequences are far worse and ongoing than\\nbreaking through the walls of denial today with the courage to make\\na stand against tyranny.\\nConnect the dots – but how?\\nA crucial aspect of perceptual programming is to portray a world in\\nwhich everything is random and almost nothing is connected to\\nanything else. Randomness cannot be coordinated by its very nature\\nand once you perceive events as random the idea they could be\\nconnected is waved away as the rantings of the tinfoil-hat brigade.\\nYou can’t plan and coordinate random you idiot! No, you can’t, but\\nyou can hide the coldly-calculated and long-planned behind the\\nillusion of randomness. A foundation manifestation of the Renegade\\nMind is to scan reality for pa\\x00erns that connect the apparently\\nrandom and turn pixels and dots into pictures. This is the way I\\nwork and have done so for more than 30 years. You look for\\nsimilarities in people, modus operandi and desired outcomes and\\nslowly, then ever quicker, the picture forms. For instance: There\\nwould seem to be no connection between the ‘Covid pandemic’ hoax\\nand the human-caused global-warming hoax and yet they are masks\\n(appropriately) on the same face seeking the same outcome. Those\\npushing the global warming myth through the Club of Rome and\\nother Cult agencies are driving the lies about ‘Covid’ – Bill Gates is\\nan obvious one, but they are endless. Why would the same people be\\ninvolved in both when they are clearly not connected? Oh, but they are. Common themes with personnel are matched by common goals.\\nThe ‘solutions’ to both ‘problems’ are centralisation of global power\\nto impose the will of the few on the many to ‘save’ humanity from\\n‘Covid’ and save the planet from an ‘existential threat’ (we need\\n‘zero Covid’ and ‘zero carbon emissions’). These, in turn, connect\\nwith the ‘dot’ of globalisation which was coined to describe the\\ncentralisation of global power in every area of life through incessant\\npolitical and corporate expansion, trading blocks and superstates\\nlike the European Union. If you are the few and you want to control\\nthe many you have to centralise power and decision-making. The\\nmore you centralise power the more power the few at the centre will\\nhave over the many; and the more that power is centralised the more\\npower those at the centre have to centralise even quicker. The\\nmomentum of centralisation gets faster and faster which is exactly\\nthe process we have witnessed. In this way the hoaxed ‘pandemic’\\nand the fakery of human-caused global warming serve the interests\\nof globalisation and the seizure of global power in the hands of the\\nCult inner-circle which is behind ‘Covid’, ‘climate change’ and\\nglobalisation. At this point random ‘dots’ become a clear and\\nobvious picture or pa\\x00ern.\\nKlaus Schwab, the classic Bond villain who founded the Cult’s\\nGates-funded World Economic Forum, published a book in 2020, The\\nGreat Reset, in which he used the ‘problem’ of ‘Covid’ to justify a\\ntotal transformation of human society to ‘save’ humanity from\\n‘climate change’. Schwab said: ‘The pandemic represents a rare but\\nnarrow window of opportunity to reﬂect, reimagine, and reset our\\nworld.’ What he didn’t mention is that the Cult he serves is behind\\nboth hoaxes as I show in my book The Answer. He and the Cult don’t\\nhave to reimagine the world. They know precisely what they want\\nand that’s why they destroyed human society with ‘Covid’ to ‘build\\nback be\\x00er’ in their grand design. Their job is not to imagine, but to\\nget humanity to imagine and agree with their plans while believing\\nit’s all random. It must be pure coincidence that ‘The Great Reset’\\nhas long been the Cult’s code name for the global imposition of\\nfascism and replaced previous code-names of the ‘New World Order’ used by Cult frontmen like Father George Bush and the ‘New\\nOrder of the Ages’ which emerged from Freemasonry and much\\nolder secret societies. New Order of the Ages appears on the reverse\\nof the Great Seal of the United States as ‘Novus ordo seclorum’\\nunderneath the Cult symbol used since way back of the pyramid and\\nall seeing-eye (Fig 3). The pyramid is the hierarchy of human control\\nheaded by the illuminated eye that symbolises the force behind the\\nCult which I will expose in later chapters. The term ‘Annuit Coeptis’\\ntranslates as ‘He favours our undertaking’. We are told the ‘He’ is\\nthe Christian god, but ‘He’ is not as I will be explaining.\\nFigure 3: The all-seeing eye of the Cult ‘god’ on the Freemason-designed Great Seal of the\\nUnited States and also on the dollar bill.\\nHaving you on\\nTwo major Cult techniques of perceptual manipulation that relate to\\nall this are what I have called since the 1990s Problem-Reaction-\\nSolution (PRS) and the Totalitarian Tiptoe (TT). They can be\\nuncovered by the inquiring mind with a simple question: Who\\nbeneﬁts? The answer usually identiﬁes the perpetrators of a given\\naction or happening through the concept of ‘he who most beneﬁts\\nfrom a crime is the one most likely to have commi\\x00ed it’. The Latin\\n‘Cue bono?’ – Who beneﬁts? – is widely a\\x00ributed to the Roman\\norator and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero. No wonder it goes back\\nso far when the concept has been relevant to human behaviour since history was recorded. Problem-Reaction-Solution is the technique\\nused to manipulate us every day by covertly creating a problem (or\\nthe illusion of one) and oﬀering the solution to the problem (or the\\nillusion of one). In the ﬁrst phase you create the problem and blame\\nsomeone or something else for why it has happened. This may relate\\nto a ﬁnancial collapse, terrorist a\\x00ack, war, global warming or\\npandemic, anything in fact that will allow you to impose the\\n‘solution’ to change society in the way you desire at that time. The\\n‘problem’ doesn’t have to be real. PRS is manipulation of perception\\nand all you need is the population to believe the problem is real.\\nHuman-caused global warming and the ‘Covid pandemic’ only have\\nto be perceived to be real for the population to accept the ‘solutions’ of\\nauthority. I refer to this technique as NO-Problem-Reaction-Solution.\\nBillions did not meekly accept house arrest from early 2020 because\\nthere was a real deadly ‘Covid pandemic’ but because they\\nperceived – believed – that to be the case. The antidote to Problem-\\nReaction-Solution is to ask who beneﬁts from the proposed solution.\\nInvariably it will be anyone who wants to justify more control\\nthrough deletion of freedom and centralisation of power and\\ndecision-making.\\nThe two world wars were Problem-Reaction-Solutions that\\ntransformed and realigned global society. Both were manipulated\\ninto being by the Cult as I have detailed in books since the mid-\\n1990s. They dramatically centralised global power, especially World\\nWar Two, which led to the United Nations and other global bodies\\nthanks to the overt and covert manipulations of the Rockefeller\\nfamily and other Cult bloodlines like the Rothschilds. The UN is a\\nstalking horse for full-blown world government that I will come to\\nshortly. The land on which the UN building stands in New York was\\ndonated by the Rockefellers and the same Cult family was behind\\nBig Pharma scalpel and drug ‘medicine’ and the creation of the\\nWorld Health Organization as part of the UN. They have been\\nstalwarts of the eugenics movement and funded Hitler’s race-purity\\nexpert’ Ernst Rudin. The human-caused global warming hoax has\\nbeen orchestrated by the Club of Rome through the UN which is manufacturing both the ‘problem’ through its Intergovernmental\\nPanel on Climate Change and imposing the ‘solution’ through its\\nAgenda 21 and Agenda 2030 which demand the total centralisation\\nof global power to ‘save the world’ from a climate hoax the United\\nNations is itself perpetrating. What a small world the Cult can be\\nseen to be particularly among the inner circles. The bedfellow of\\nProblem-Reaction-Solution is the Totalitarian Tiptoe which became\\nthe Totalitarian Sprint in 2020. The technique is fashioned to hide the\\ncarefully-coordinated behind the cover of apparently random events.\\nYou start the sequence at ‘A’ and you know you are heading for ‘Z’.\\nYou don’t want people to know that and each step on the journey is\\npresented as a random happening while all the steps strung together\\nlead in the same direction. The speed may have quickened\\ndramatically in recent times, but you can still see the incremental\\napproach of the Tiptoe in the case of ‘Covid’ as each new imposition\\ntakes us deeper into fascism. Tell people they have to do this or that\\nto get back to ‘normal’, then this and this and this. With each new\\ndemand adding to the ones that went before the population’s\\nfreedom is deleted until it disappears. The spider wraps its web\\naround the ﬂies more comprehensively with each new diktat. I’ll\\nhighlight this in more detail when I get to the ‘Covid’ hoax and how\\nit has been pulled oﬀ. Another prime example of the Totalitarian\\nTiptoe is how the Cult-created European Union went from a ‘free-\\ntrade zone’ to a centralised bureaucratic dictatorship through the\\nTiptoe of incremental centralisation of power until nations became\\nmere administrative units for Cult-owned dark suits in Brussels.\\nThe antidote to ignorance is knowledge which the Cult seeks\\nvehemently to deny us, but despite the systematic censorship to that\\nend the Renegade Mind can overcome this by vociferously seeking\\nout the facts no ma\\x00er the impediments put in the way. There is also\\na method of thinking and perceiving – knowing – that doesn’t even\\nneed names, dates, place-type facts to identify the pa\\x00erns that\\nreveal the story. I’ll get to that in the ﬁnal chapter. All you need to\\nknow about the manipulation of human society and to what end is\\nstill out there – at the time of writing – in the form of books, videos and websites for those that really want to breach the walls of\\nprogrammed perception. To access this knowledge requires the\\nabandonment of the mainstream media as a source of information in\\nthe awareness that this is owned and controlled by the Cult and\\ntherefore promotes mass perceptions that suit the Cult. Mainstream\\nmedia lies all day, every day. That is its function and very reason for\\nbeing. Where it does tell the truth, here and there, is only because the\\ntruth and the Cult agenda very occasionally coincide. If you look for\\nfact and insight to the BBC, CNN and virtually all the rest of them\\nyou are asking to be conned and perceptually programmed.\\nKnow the outcome and you’ll see the journey\\nEvents seem random when you have no idea where the world is\\nbeing taken. Once you do the random becomes the carefully\\nplanned. Know the outcome and you’ll see the journey is a phrase I\\nhave been using for a long time to give context to daily happenings\\nthat appear unconnected. Does a problem, or illusion of a problem,\\ntrigger a proposed ‘solution’ that further drives society in the\\ndirection of the outcome? Invariably the answer will be yes and the\\nrandom – abracadabra – becomes the clearly coordinated. So what is\\nthis outcome that unlocks the door to a massively expanded\\nunderstanding of daily events? I will summarise its major aspects –\\nthe ﬁne detail is in my other books – and those new to this\\ninformation will see that the world they thought they were living in\\nis a very diﬀerent place. The foundation of the Cult agenda is the\\nincessant centralisation of power and all such centralisation is\\nultimately in pursuit of Cult control on a global level. I have\\ndescribed for a long time the planned world structure of top-down\\ndictatorship as the Hunger Games Society. The term obviously\\ncomes from the movie series which portrayed a world in which a\\nfew living in military-protected hi-tech luxury were the overlords of\\na population condemned to abject poverty in isolated ‘sectors’ that\\nwere not allowed to interact. ‘Covid’ lockdowns and travel bans\\nanyone? The ‘Hunger Games’ pyramid of structural control has the\\ninner circle of the Cult at the top with pre\\x00y much the entire population at the bo\\x00om under their control through dependency\\nfor survival on the Cult. The whole structure is planned to be\\nprotected and enforced by a military-police state (Fig 4).\\nHere you have the reason for the global lockdowns of the fake\\npandemic to coldly destroy independent incomes and livelihoods\\nand make everyone dependent on the ‘state’ (the Cult that controls\\nthe ‘states’). I have warned in my books for many years about the\\nplan to introduce a ‘guaranteed income’ – a barely survivable\\npi\\x00ance – designed to impose dependency when employment was\\ndestroyed by AI technology and now even more comprehensively at\\ngreat speed by the ‘Covid’ scam. Once the pandemic was played and\\nlockdown consequences began to delete independent income the\\nauthorities began to talk right on cue about the need for a\\nguaranteed income and a ‘Great Reset’. Guaranteed income will be\\npresented as benevolent governments seeking to help a desperate\\npeople – desperate as a direct result of actions of the same\\ngovernments. The truth is that such payments are a trap. You will\\nonly get them if you do exactly what the authorities demand\\nincluding mass vaccination (genetic manipulation). We have seen\\nthis theme already in Australia where those dependent on\\ngovernment beneﬁts have them reduced if parents don’t agree to\\nhave their children vaccinated according to an insane health-\\ndestroying government-dictated schedule. Calculated economic\\ncollapse applies to governments as well as people. The Cult wants\\nrid of countries through the creation of a world state with countries\\nbroken up into regions ruled by a world government and super\\nstates like the European Union. Countries must be bankrupted, too,\\nto this end and it’s being achieved by the trillions in ‘rescue\\npackages’ and furlough payments, trillions in lost taxation, and\\nmoney-no-object spending on ‘Covid’ including constant all-\\nmedium advertising (programming) which has made the media\\ndependent on government for much of its income. The day of\\nreckoning is coming – as planned – for government spending and\\ngiven that it has been made possible by printing money and not by\\nproduction/taxation there is inﬂation on the way that has the potential to wipe out monetary value. In that case there will be no\\nneed for the Cult to steal your money. It just won’t be worth\\nanything (see the German Weimar Republic before the Nazis took\\nover). Many have been okay with lockdowns while ge\\x00ing a\\npercentage of their income from so-called furlough payments\\nwithout having to work. Those payments are dependent, however,\\non people having at least a theoretical job with a business considered\\nnon-essential and ordered to close. As these business go under\\nbecause they are closed by lockdown a\\x00er lockdown the furlough\\nstops and it will for everyone eventually. Then what? The ‘then\\nwhat?’ is precisely the idea.\\nFigure 4: The Hunger Games Society structure I have long warned was planned and now the\\n‘Covid’ hoax has made it possible. This is the real reason for lockdowns.\\nHired hands\\nBetween the Hunger Games Cult elite and the dependent population\\nis planned to be a vicious military-police state (a fusion of the two\\ninto one force). This has been in the making for a long time with\\npolice looking ever more like the military and carrying weapons to\\nmatch. The pandemic scam has seen this process accelerate so fast as lockdown house arrest is brutally enforced by carefully recruited\\nfascist minds and gormless system-servers. The police and military\\nare planned to merge into a centrally-directed world army in a\\nglobal structure headed by a world government which wouldn’t be\\nelected even by the election ﬁxes now in place. The world army is\\nnot planned even to be human and instead wars would be fought,\\nprimarily against the population, using robot technology controlled\\nby artiﬁcial intelligence. I have been warning about this for decades\\nand now militaries around the world are being transformed by this\\nvery AI technology. The global regime that I describe is a particular\\nform of fascism known as a technocracy in which decisions are not\\nmade by clueless and co-opted politicians but by unelected\\ntechnocrats – scientists, engineers, technologists and bureaucrats.\\nCult-owned-and-controlled Silicon Valley giants are examples of\\ntechnocracy and they already have far more power to direct world\\nevents than governments. They are with their censorship selecting\\ngovernments. I know that some are calling the ‘Great Reset’ a\\nMarxist communist takeover, but fascism and Marxism are diﬀerent\\nlabels for the same tyranny. Tell those who lived in fascist Germany\\nand Stalinist Russia that there was a diﬀerence in the way their\\nfreedom was deleted and their lives controlled. I could call it a fascist\\ntechnocracy or a Marxist technocracy and they would be equally\\naccurate. The Hunger Games society with its world government\\nstructure would oversee a world army, world central bank and single\\nworld cashless currency imposing its will on a microchipped\\npopulation (Fig 5). Scan its diﬀerent elements and see how the\\nillusory pandemic is forcing society in this very direction at great\\nspeed. Leaders of 23 countries and the World Health Organization\\n(WHO) backed the idea in March, 2021, of a global treaty for\\n‘international cooperation’ in ‘health emergencies’ and nations\\nshould ‘come together as a global community for peaceful\\ncooperation that extends beyond this crisis’. Cut the Orwellian\\nbullshit and this means another step towards global government.\\nThe plan includes a cashless digital money system that I ﬁrst warned\\nabout in 1993. Right at the start of ‘Covid’ the deeply corrupt Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the crooked and merely gofer ‘head’ of the\\nWorld Health Organization, said it was possible to catch the ‘virus’\\nby touching cash and it was be\\x00er to use cashless means. The claim\\nwas ridiculous nonsense and like the whole ‘Covid’ mind-trick it\\nwas nothing to do with ‘health’ and everything to do with pushing\\nevery aspect of the Cult agenda. As a result of the Tedros lie the use\\nof cash has plummeted. The Cult script involves a single world\\ndigital currency that would eventually be technologically embedded\\nin the body. China is a massive global centre for the Cult and if you\\nwatch what is happening there you will know what is planned for\\neverywhere. The Chinese government is developing a digital\\ncurrency which would allow ﬁnes to be deducted immediately via\\nAI for anyone caught on camera breaking its fantastic list of laws\\nand the money is going to be programmable with an expiry date to\\nensure that no one can accrue wealth except the Cult and its\\noperatives.\\nFigure 5: The structure of global control the Cult has been working towards for so long and\\nthis has been enormously advanced by the ‘Covid’ illusion.\\nSerfdom is so smart\\nThe Cult plan is far wider, extreme, and more comprehensive than\\neven most conspiracy researchers appreciate and I will come to the\\ntrue depths of deceit and control in the chapters ‘Who controls the Cult?’ and ‘Escaping Wetiko’. Even the world that we know is crazy\\nenough. We are being deluged with ever more sophisticated and\\ncontrolling technology under the heading of ‘smart’. We have smart\\ntelevisions, smart meters, smart cards, smart cars, smart driving,\\nsmart roads, smart pills, smart patches, smart watches, smart skin,\\nsmart borders, smart pavements, smart streets, smart cities, smart\\ncommunities, smart environments, smart growth, smart planet ...\\nsmart everything around us. Smart technologies and methods of\\noperation are designed to interlock to create a global Smart Grid\\nconnecting the entirety of human society including human minds to\\ncreate a centrally-dictated ‘hive’ mind. ‘Smart cities’ is code for\\ndensely-occupied megacities of total surveillance and control\\nthrough AI. Ever more destructive frequency communication\\nsystems like 5G have been rolled out without any oﬃcial testing for\\nhealth and psychological eﬀects (colossal). 5G/6G/7G systems are\\nneeded to run the Smart Grid and each one becomes more\\ndestructive of body and mind. Deleting independent income is\\ncrucial to forcing people into these AI-policed prisons by ending\\nprivate property ownership (except for the Cult elite). The Cult’s\\nGreat Reset now openly foresees a global society in which no one\\nwill own any possessions and everything will be rented while the\\nCult would own literally everything under the guise of government\\nand corporations. The aim has been to use the lockdowns to destroy\\nsources of income on a mass scale and when the people are destitute\\nand in unrepayable amounts of debt (problem) Cult assets come\\nforward with the pledge to write-oﬀ debt in return for handing over\\nall property and possessions (solution). Everything – literally\\neverything including people – would be connected to the Internet\\nvia AI. I was warning years ago about the coming Internet of Things\\n(IoT) in which all devices and technology from your car to your\\nfridge would be plugged into the Internet and controlled by AI.\\nNow we are already there with much more to come. The next stage\\nis the Internet of Everything (IoE) which is planned to include the\\nconnection of AI to the human brain and body to replace the human\\nmind with a centrally-controlled AI mind. Instead of perceptions being manipulated through control of information and censorship\\nthose perceptions would come direct from the Cult through AI.\\nWhat do you think? You think whatever AI decides that you think.\\nIn human terms there would be no individual ‘think’ any longer. Too\\nincredible? The ravings of a lunatic? Not at all. Cult-owned crazies\\nin Silicon Valley have been telling us the plan for years without\\nexplaining the real motivation and calculated implications. These\\ninclude Google executive and ‘futurist’ Ray Kurzweil who highlights\\nthe year 2030 for when this would be underway. He said:\\nOur thinking ... will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking ... humans will be\\nable to extend their limitations and ‘think in the cloud’ ... We’re going to put gateways to the\\ncloud in our brains ... We’re going to gradually merge and enhance ourselves ... In my view,\\nthat’s the nature of being human – we transcend our limitations.\\nAs the technology becomes vastly superior to what we are then the small proportion that is\\nstill human gets smaller and smaller and smaller until it’s just utterly negligible.\\nThe sales-pitch of Kurzweil and Cult-owned Silicon Valley is that\\nthis would make us ‘super-human’ when the real aim is to make us\\npost-human and no longer ‘human’ in the sense that we have come\\nto know. The entire global population would be connected to AI and\\nbecome the centrally-controlled ‘hive-mind’ of externally-delivered\\nperceptions. The Smart Grid being installed to impose the Cult’s will\\non the world is being constructed to allow particular locations – even\\none location – to control the whole global system. From these prime\\ncontrol centres, which absolutely include China and Israel, anything\\nconnected to the Internet would be switched on or oﬀ and\\nmanipulated at will. Energy systems could be cut, communication\\nvia the Internet taken down, computer-controlled driverless\\nautonomous vehicles driven oﬀ the road, medical devices switched\\noﬀ, the potential is limitless given how much AI and Internet\\nconnections now run human society. We have seen nothing yet if we\\nallow this to continue. Autonomous vehicle makers are working\\nwith law enforcement to produce cars designed to automatically pull\\nover if they detect a police or emergency vehicle ﬂashing from up to\\n100 feet away. At a police stop the car would be unlocked and the window rolled down automatically. Vehicles would only take you\\nwhere the computer (the state) allowed. The end of petrol vehicles\\nand speed limiters on all new cars in the UK and EU from 2022 are\\nsteps leading to electric computerised transport over which\\nultimately you have no control. The picture is far bigger even than\\nthe Cult global network or web and that will become clear when I\\nget to the nature of the ‘spider’. There is a connection between all\\nthese happenings and the instigation of DNA-manipulating\\n‘vaccines’ (which aren’t ‘vaccines’) justiﬁed by the ‘Covid’ hoax. That\\nconnection is the unfolding plan to transform the human body from\\na biological to a synthetic biological state and this is why synthetic\\nbiology is such a fast-emerging discipline of mainstream science.\\n‘Covid vaccines’ are infusing self-replicating synthetic genetic\\nmaterial into the cells to cumulatively take us on the Totalitarian\\nTiptoe from Human 1.0 to the synthetic biological Human 2.0 which\\nwill be physically and perceptually a\\x00ached to the Smart Grid to one\\nhundred percent control every thought, perception and deed.\\nHumanity needs to wake up and fast.\\nThis is the barest explanation of where the ‘outcome’ is planned to\\ngo but it’s enough to see the journey happening all around us. Those\\nnew to this information will already see ‘Covid’ in a whole new\\ncontext. I will add much more detail as we go along, but for the\\nminutiae evidence see my mega-works, The Answer, The Trigger and\\nEverything You Need to Know But Have Never Been Told.\\nNow – how does a Renegade Mind see the ‘world’? A\\nCHAPTER TWO\\nRenegade Perception\\nIt is one thing to be clever and another to be wise\\nGeorge R.R. Martin\\nsimple deﬁnition of the diﬀerence between a programmed\\nmind and a Renegade Mind would be that one sees only dots\\nwhile the other connects them to see the picture. Reading reality\\nwith accuracy requires the observer to (a) know the planned\\noutcome and (b) realise that everything, but everything, is connected.\\nThe entirety of inﬁnite reality is connected – that’s its very nature –\\nand with human society an expression of inﬁnite reality the same\\nmust apply. Simple cause and eﬀect is a connection. The eﬀect is\\ntriggered by the cause and the eﬀect then becomes the cause of\\nanother eﬀect. Nothing happens in isolation because it can’t. Life in\\nwhatever reality is simple choice and consequence. We make choices\\nand these lead to consequences. If we don’t like the consequences we\\ncan make diﬀerent choices and get diﬀerent consequences which\\nlead to other choices and consequences. The choice and the\\nconsequence are not only connected they are indivisible. You can’t\\nhave one without the other as an old song goes. A few cannot\\ncontrol the world unless those being controlled allow that to happen\\n– cause and eﬀect, choice and consequence. Control – who has it and\\nwho doesn’t – is a two-way process, a symbiotic relationship,\\ninvolving the controller and controlled. ‘They took my freedom\\naway!!’ Well, yes, but you also gave it to them. Humanity is subjected to mass control because humanity has acquiesced to that\\ncontrol. This is all cause and eﬀect and literally a case of give and\\ntake. In the same way world events of every kind are connected and\\nthe Cult works incessantly to sell the illusion of the random and\\ncoincidental to maintain the essential (to them) perception of dots\\nthat hide the picture. Renegade Minds know this and constantly\\nscan the world for pa\\x00erns of connection. This is absolutely pivotal\\nin understanding the happenings in the world and without that\\nperspective clarity is impossible. First you know the planned\\noutcome and then you identify the steps on the journey – the day-by-\\nday apparently random which, when connected in relation to the\\noutcome, no longer appear as individual events, but as the\\nproverbial chain of events leading in the same direction. I’ll give you\\nsome examples:\\nPolitical puppet show\\nWe are told to believe that politics is ‘adversarial’ in that diﬀerent\\nparties with diﬀerent beliefs engage in an endless tussle for power.\\nThere may have been some truth in that up to a point – and only a\\npoint – but today divisions between ‘diﬀerent’ parties are rhetorical\\nnot ideological. Even the rhetorical is fusing into one-speak as the\\nparties eject any remaining free thinkers while others succumb to the\\never-gathering intimidation of anyone with the ‘wrong’ opinion. The\\nCult is not a new phenomenon and can be traced back thousands of\\nyears as my books have documented. Its intergenerational initiates\\nhave been manipulating events with increasing eﬀect the more that\\nglobal power has been centralised. In ancient times the Cult secured\\ncontrol through the system of monarchy in which ‘special’\\nbloodlines (of which more later) demanded the right to rule as kings\\nand queens simply by birthright and by vanquishing others who\\nclaimed the same birthright. There came a time, however, when\\npeople had matured enough to see the unfairness of such tyranny\\nand demanded a say in who governed them. Note the word –\\ngoverned them. Not served them – governed them, hence government\\ndeﬁned as ‘the political direction and control exercised over the actions of the members, citizens, or inhabitants of communities,\\nsocieties, and states; direction of the aﬀairs of a state, community,\\netc.’ Governments exercise control over rather than serve just like the\\nmonarchies before them. Bizarrely there are still countries like the\\nUnited Kingdom which are ruled by a monarch and a government\\nthat oﬃcially answers to the monarch. The UK head of state and that\\nof Commonwealth countries such as Canada, Australia and New\\nZealand is ‘selected’ by who in a single family had unprotected sex\\nwith whom and in what order. Pinch me it can’t be true. Ouch! Shit,\\nit is. The demise of monarchies in most countries oﬀered a potential\\nvacuum in which some form of free and fair society could arise and\\nthe Cult had that base covered. Monarchies had served its interests\\nbut they couldn’t continue in the face of such widespread opposition\\nand, anyway, replacing a ‘royal’ dictatorship that people could see\\nwith a dictatorship ‘of the people’ hiding behind the concept of\\n‘democracy’ presented far greater manipulative possibilities and\\nways of hiding coordinated tyranny behind the illusion of ‘freedom’.\\nDemocracy is quite wrongly deﬁned as government selected by\\nthe population. This is not the case at all. It is government selected\\nby some of the population (and then only in theory). This ‘some’\\ndoesn’t even have to be the majority as we have seen so o\\x00en in ﬁrst-\\npast-the-post elections in which the so-called majority party wins\\nfewer votes than the ‘losing’ parties combined. Democracy can give\\ntotal power to a party in government from a minority of the votes\\ncast. It’s a sleight of hand to sell tyranny as freedom. Seventy-four\\nmillion Trump-supporting Americans didn’t vote for the\\n‘Democratic’ Party of Joe Biden in the distinctly dodgy election in\\n2020 and yet far from acknowledging the wishes and feelings of that\\ngreat percentage of American society the Cult-owned Biden\\ngovernment set out from day one to destroy them and their right to a\\nvoice and opinion. Empty shell Biden and his Cult handlers said\\nthey were doing this to ‘protect democracy’. Such is the level of\\nlunacy and sickness to which politics has descended. Connect the\\ndots and relate them to the desired outcome – a world government\\nrun by self-appointed technocrats and no longer even elected politicians. While operating through its political agents in\\ngovernment the Cult is at the same time encouraging public distain\\nfor politicians by pu\\x00ing idiots and incompetents in theoretical\\npower on the road to deleting them. The idea is to instil a public\\nreaction that says of the technocrats: ‘Well, they couldn’t do any\\nworse than the pathetic politicians.’ It’s all about controlling\\nperception and Renegade Minds can see through that while\\nprogrammed minds cannot when they are ignorant of both the\\nplanned outcome and the manipulation techniques employed to\\nsecure that end. This knowledge can be learned, however, and fast if\\npeople choose to get informed.\\nPolitics may at ﬁrst sight appear very diﬃcult to control from a\\ncentral point. I mean look at the ‘diﬀerent’ parties and how would\\nyou be able to oversee them all and their constituent parts? In truth,\\nit’s very straightforward because of their structure. We are back to\\nthe pyramid of imposition and acquiescence. Organisations are\\nstructured in the same way as the system as a whole. Political parties\\nare not open forums of free expression. They are hierarchies. I was a\\nnational spokesman for the British Green Party which claimed to be\\na diﬀerent kind of politics in which inﬂuence and power was\\ndevolved; but I can tell you from direct experience – and it’s far\\nworse now – that Green parties are run as hierarchies like all the\\nothers however much they may try to hide that fact or kid\\nthemselves that it’s not true. A very few at the top of all political\\nparties are directing policy and personnel. They decide if you are\\nelevated in the party or serve as a government minister and to do\\nthat you have to be a yes man or woman. Look at all the maverick\\npolitical thinkers who never ascended the greasy pole. If you want to\\nprogress within the party or reach ‘high-oﬃce’ you need to fall into\\nline and conform. Exceptions to this are rare indeed. Should you\\nwant to run for parliament or Congress you have to persuade the\\nlocal or state level of the party to select you and for that you need to\\nplay the game as dictated by the hierarchy. If you secure election and\\nwish to progress within the greater structure you need to go on\\nconforming to what is acceptable to those running the hierarchy from the peak of the pyramid. Political parties are perceptual gulags\\nand the very fact that there are party ‘Whips’ appointed to ‘whip’\\npoliticians into voting the way the hierarchy demands exposes the\\nridiculous idea that politicians are elected to serve the people they\\nare supposed to represent. Cult operatives and manipulation has\\nlong seized control of major parties that have any chance of forming\\na government and at least most of those that haven’t. A new party\\nforms and the Cult goes to work to inﬁltrate and direct. This has\\nreached such a level today that you see video compilations of\\n‘leaders’ of all parties whether Democrats, Republicans,\\nConservative, Labour and Green parroting the same Cult mantra of\\n‘Build Back Be\\x00er’ and the ‘Great Reset’ which are straight oﬀ the\\nCult song-sheet to describe the transformation of global society in\\nresponse to the Cult-instigated hoaxes of the ‘Covid pandemic’ and\\nhuman-caused ‘climate change’. To see Caroline Lucas, the Green\\nParty MP that I knew when I was in the party in the 1980s, speaking\\nin support of plans proposed by Cult operative Klaus Schwab\\nrepresenting the billionaire global elite is a real head-shaker.\\nMany parties – one master\\nThe party system is another mind-trick and was instigated to change\\nthe nature of the dictatorship by swapping ‘royalty’ for dark suits\\nthat people believed – though now ever less so – represented their\\ninterests. Understanding this trick is to realise that a single force (the\\nCult) controls all parties either directly in terms of the major ones or\\nthrough manipulation of perception and ideology with others. You\\ndon’t need to manipulate Green parties to demand your\\ntransformation of society in the name of ‘climate change’ when they\\nare obsessed with the lie that this is essential to ‘save the planet’. You\\njust give them a platform and away they go serving your interests\\nwhile believing they are being environmentally virtuous. America’s\\npolitical structure is a perfect blueprint for how the two or multi-\\nparty system is really a one-party state. The Republican Party is\\ncontrolled from one step back in the shadows by a group made up of\\nbillionaires and their gofers known as neoconservatives or Neocons. I have exposed them in ﬁne detail in my books and they were the\\ndriving force behind the policies of the imbecilic presidency of Boy\\nGeorge Bush which included 9/11 (see The Trigger for a\\ncomprehensive demolition of the oﬃcial story), the subsequent ‘war\\non terror’ (war of terror) and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.\\nThe la\\x00er was a No-Problem-Reaction-Solution based on claims by\\nCult operatives, including Bush and British Prime Minister Tony\\nBlair, about Saddam Hussein’s ‘weapons of mass destruction’ which\\ndid not exist as war criminals Bush and Blair well knew.\\nFigure 6: Different front people, different parties – same control system.\\nThe Democratic Party has its own ‘Neocon’ group controlling\\nfrom the background which I call the ‘Democons’ and here’s the\\npenny-drop – the Neocons and Democons answer to the same\\nmasters one step further back into the shadows (Fig 6). At that level\\nof the Cult the Republican and Democrat parties are controlled by\\nthe same people and no ma\\x00er which is in power the Cult is in\\npower. This is how it works in almost every country and certainly in\\nBritain with Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green\\nparties now all on the same page whatever the rhetoric may be in\\ntheir feeble a\\x00empts to appear diﬀerent. Neocons operated at the\\ntime of Bush through a think tank called The Project for the New\\nAmerican Century which in September, 2000, published a document\\nentitled Rebuilding America’s Defenses: Strategies, Forces, and Resources For a New Century demanding that America ﬁght ‘multiple,\\nsimultaneous major theatre wars’ as a ‘core mission’ to force regime-\\nchange in countries including Iraq, Libya and Syria. Neocons\\narranged for Bush (‘Republican’) and Blair (‘Labour Party’) to front-\\nup the invasion of Iraq and when they departed the Democons\\norchestrated the targeting of Libya and Syria through Barack Obama\\n(‘Democrat’) and British Prime Minister David Cameron\\n(‘Conservative Party’). We have ‘diﬀerent’ parties and ‘diﬀerent’\\npeople, but the same unfolding script. The more the Cult has seized\\nthe reigns of parties and personnel the more their policies have\\ntransparently pursued the same agenda to the point where the\\nfascist ‘Covid’ impositions of the Conservative junta of Jackboot\\nJohnson in Britain were opposed by the Labour Party because they\\nwere not fascist enough. The Labour Party is likened to the US\\nDemocrats while the Conservative Party is akin to a British version\\nof the Republicans and on both sides of the Atlantic they all speak\\nthe same language and support the direction demanded by the Cult\\nalthough some more enthusiastically than others. It’s a similar story\\nin country a\\x00er country because it’s all centrally controlled. Oh, but\\nwhat about Trump? I’ll come to him shortly. Political ‘choice’ in the\\n‘party’ system goes like this: You vote for Party A and they get into\\ngovernment. You don’t like what they do so next time you vote for\\nParty B and they get into government. You don’t like what they do\\nwhen it’s pre\\x00y much the same as Party A and why wouldn’t that be\\nwith both controlled by the same force? Given that only two,\\nsometimes three, parties have any chance of forming a government\\nto get rid of Party B that you don’t like you have to vote again for\\nParty A which … you don’t like. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what\\nthey call ‘democracy’ which we are told – wrongly – is a term\\ninterchangeable with ‘freedom’.\\nThe cult of cults\\nAt this point I need to introduce a major expression of the Global\\nCult known as Sabbatian-Frankism. Sabbatian is also spelt as\\nSabbatean. I will summarise here. I have published major exposés and detailed background in other works. Sabbatian-Frankism\\ncombines the names of two frauds posing as ‘Jewish’ men, Sabbatai\\nZevi (1626-1676), a rabbi, black magician and occultist who\\nproclaimed he was the Jewish messiah; and Jacob Frank (1726-1791),\\nthe Polish ‘Jew’, black magician and occultist who said he was the\\nreincarnation of ‘messiah’ Zevi and biblical patriarch Jacob. They\\nworked across two centuries to establish the Sabbatian-Frankist cult\\nthat plays a major, indeed central, role in the manipulation of human\\nsociety by the Global Cult which has its origins much further back in\\nhistory than Sabbatai Zevi. I should emphasise two points here in\\nresponse to the shrill voices that will scream ‘anti-Semitism’: (1)\\nSabbatian-Frankists are NOT Jewish and only pose as such to hide\\ntheir cult behind a Jewish façade; and (2) my information about this\\ncult has come from Jewish sources who have long realised that their\\nsociety and community has been inﬁltrated and taken over by\\ninterloper Sabbatian-Frankists. Inﬁltration has been the foundation\\ntechnique of Sabbatian-Frankism from its oﬃcial origin in the 17th\\ncentury. Zevi’s Sabbatian sect a\\x00racted a massive following\\ndescribed as the biggest messianic movement in Jewish history,\\nspreading as far as Africa and Asia, and he promised a return for the\\nJews to the ‘Promised Land’ of Israel. Sabbatianism was not Judaism\\nbut an inversion of everything that mainstream Judaism stood for. So\\nmuch so that this sinister cult would have a feast day when Judaism\\nhad a fast day and whatever was forbidden in Judaism the\\nSabbatians were encouraged and even commanded to do. This\\nincluded incest and what would be today called Satanism. Members\\nwere forbidden to marry outside the sect and there was a system of\\nkeeping their children ignorant of what they were part of until they\\nwere old enough to be trusted not to unknowingly reveal anything\\nto outsiders. The same system is employed to this day by the Global\\nCult in general which Sabbatian-Frankism has enormously\\ninﬂuenced and now largely controls.\\nZevi and his Sabbatians suﬀered a setback with the intervention\\nby the Sultan of the Islamic O\\x00oman Empire in the Middle East and\\nwhat is now the Republic of Turkey where Zevi was located. The Sultan gave him the choice of proving his ‘divinity’, converting to\\nIslam or facing torture and death. Funnily enough Zevi chose to\\nconvert or at least appear to. Some of his supporters were\\ndisillusioned and dri\\x00ed away, but many did not with 300 families\\nalso converting – only in theory – to Islam. They continued behind\\nthis Islamic smokescreen to follow the goals, rules and rituals of\\nSabbatianism and became known as ‘crypto-Jews’ or the ‘Dönmeh’\\nwhich means ‘to turn’. This is rather ironic because they didn’t ‘turn’\\nand instead hid behind a fake Islamic persona. The process of\\nappearing to be one thing while being very much another would\\nbecome the calling card of Sabbatianism especially a\\x00er Zevi’s death\\nand the arrival of the Satanist Jacob Frank in the 18th century when\\nthe cult became Sabbatian-Frankism and plumbed still new depths\\nof depravity and inﬁltration which included – still includes – human\\nsacriﬁce and sex with children. Wherever Sabbatians go paedophilia\\nand Satanism follow and is it really a surprise that Hollywood is so\\ninfested with child abuse and Satanism when it was established by\\nSabbatian-Frankists and is still controlled by them? Hollywood has\\nbeen one of the prime vehicles for global perceptual programming\\nand manipulation. How many believe the version of ‘history’\\nportrayed in movies when it is a travesty and inversion (again) of the\\ntruth? Rabbi Marvin Antelman describes Frankism in his book, To\\nEliminate the Opiate, as ‘a movement of complete evil’ while Jewish\\nprofessor Gershom Scholem said of Frank in The Messianic Idea in\\nJudaism: ‘In all his actions [he was] a truly corrupt and degenerate\\nindividual ... one of the most frightening phenomena in the whole of\\nJewish history.’ Frank was excommunicated by traditional rabbis, as\\nwas Zevi, but Frank was undeterred and enjoyed vital support from\\nthe House of Rothschild, the infamous banking dynasty whose\\ninner-core are Sabbatian-Frankists and not Jews. Inﬁltration of the\\nRoman Church and Vatican was instigated by Frank with many\\nDönmeh ‘turning’ again to convert to Roman Catholicism with a\\nview to hĳacking the reins of power. This was the ever-repeating\\nmodus operandi and continues to be so. Pose as an advocate of the\\nreligion, culture or country that you want to control and then manipulate your people into the positions of authority and inﬂuence\\nlargely as advisers, administrators and Svengalis for those that\\nappear to be in power. They did this with Judaism, Christianity\\n(Christian Zionism is part of this), Islam and other religions and\\nnations until Sabbatian-Frankism spanned the world as it does\\ntoday.\\nSabbatian Saudis and the terror network\\nOne expression of the Sabbatian-Frankist Dönmeh within Islam is\\nthe ruling family of Saudi Arabia, the House of Saud, through which\\ncame the vile distortion of Islam known as Wahhabism. This is the\\nviolent creed followed by terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS or\\nIslamic State. Wahhabism is the hand-chopping, head-chopping\\n‘religion’ of Saudi Arabia which is used to keep the people in a\\nconstant state of fear so the interloper House of Saud can continue to\\nrule. Al-Qaeda and Islamic State were lavishly funded by the House\\nof Saud while being created and directed by the Sabbatian-Frankist\\nnetwork in the United States that operates through the Pentagon,\\nCIA and the government in general of whichever ‘party’. The front\\nman for the establishment of Wahhabism in the middle of the 18th\\ncentury was a Sabbatian-Frankist ‘crypto-Jew’ posing as Islamic\\ncalled Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. His daughter would marry\\nthe son of Muhammad bin Saud who established the ﬁrst Saudi state\\nbefore his death in 1765 with support from the British Empire. Bin\\nSaud’s successors would establish modern Saudi Arabia in league\\nwith the British and Americans in 1932 which allowed them to seize\\ncontrol of Islam’s major shrines in Mecca and Medina. They have\\ndictated the direction of Sunni Islam ever since while Iran is the\\nmajor centre of the Shiite version and here we have the source of at\\nleast the public conﬂict between them. The Sabbatian network has\\nused its Wahhabi extremists to carry out Problem-Reaction-Solution\\nterrorist a\\x00acks in the name of ‘Al-Qaeda’ and ‘Islamic State’ to\\njustify a devastating ‘war on terror’, ever-increasing surveillance of\\nthe population and to terrify people into compliance. Another\\ninsight of the Renegade Mind is the streetwise understanding that just because a country, location or people are a\\x00acked doesn’t mean\\nthat those apparently representing that country, location or people\\nare not behind the a\\x00ackers. O\\x00en they are orchestrating the a\\x00acks\\nbecause of the societal changes that can be then justiﬁed in the name\\nof ‘saving the population from terrorists’.\\nI show in great detail in The Trigger how Sabbatian-Frankists were\\nthe real perpetrators of 9/11 and not ‘19 Arab hĳackers’ who were\\nblamed for what happened. Observe what was justiﬁed in the name\\nof 9/11 alone in terms of Middle East invasions, mass surveillance\\nand control that fulﬁlled the demands of the Project for the New\\nAmerican Century document published by the Sabbatian Neocons.\\nWhat appear to be enemies are on the deep inside players on the\\nsame Sabbatian team. Israel and Arab ‘royal’ dictatorships are all\\nruled by Sabbatians and the recent peace agreements between Israel\\nand Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and others are\\nonly making formal what has always been the case behind the\\nscenes. Palestinians who have been subjected to grotesque tyranny\\nsince Israel was bombed and terrorised into existence in 1948 have\\nnever stood a chance. Sabbatian-Frankists have controlled Israel (so\\nthe constant theme of violence and war which Sabbatians love) and\\nthey have controlled the Arab countries that Palestinians have\\nlooked to for real support that never comes. ‘Royal families’ of the\\nArab world in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE, etc., are all Sabbatians\\nwith allegiance to the aims of the cult and not what is best for their\\nArabic populations. They have stolen the oil and ﬁnancial resources\\nfrom their people by false claims to be ‘royal dynasties’ with a\\ngenetic right to rule and by employing vicious militaries to impose\\ntheir will.\\nSatanic ‘illumination’\\nThe Satanist Jacob Frank formed an alliance in 1773 with two other\\nSabbatians, Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812), founder of the\\nRothschild banking dynasty, and Jesuit-educated fraudulent Jew,\\nAdam Weishaupt, and this led to the formation of the Bavarian\\nIlluminati, ﬁrstly under another name, in 1776. The Illuminati would be the manipulating force behind the French Revolution (1789-1799)\\nand was also involved in the American Revolution (1775-1783)\\nbefore and a\\x00er the Illuminati’s oﬃcial creation. Weishaupt would\\nlater become (in public) a Protestant Christian in archetypal\\nSabbatian style. I read that his name can be decoded as Adam-Weis-\\nhaupt or ‘the ﬁrst man to lead those who know’. He wasn’t a leader\\nin the sense that he was a subordinate, but he did lead those below\\nhim in a crusade of transforming human society that still continues\\ntoday. The theme was conﬁrmed as early as 1785 when a horseman\\ncourier called Lanz was reported to be struck by lighting and\\nextensive Illuminati documents were found in his saddlebags. They\\nmade the link to Weishaupt and detailed the plan for world takeover.\\nCurrent events with ‘Covid’ fascism have been in the making for a\\nvery long time. Jacob Frank was jailed for 13 years by the Catholic\\nInquisition a\\x00er his arrest in 1760 and on his release he headed for\\nFrankfurt, Germany, home city and headquarters of the House of\\nRothschild where the alliance was struck with Mayer Amschel\\nRothschild and Weishaupt. Rothschild arranged for Frank to be\\ngiven the title of Baron and he became a wealthy nobleman with a\\nbig following of Jews in Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire\\nand other European countries. Most of them would have believed he\\nwas on their side.\\nThe name ‘Illuminati’ came from the Zohar which is a body of\\nworks in the Jewish mystical ‘bible’ called the Kabbalah. ‘Zohar’ is\\nthe foundation of Sabbatian-Frankist belief and in Hebrew ‘Zohar’\\nmeans ‘splendour’, ‘radiance’, ‘illuminated’, and so we have\\n‘Illuminati’. They claim to be the ‘Illuminated Ones’ from their\\nknowledge systematically hidden from the human population and\\npassed on through generations of carefully-chosen initiates in the\\nglobal secret society network or Cult. Hidden knowledge includes\\nan awareness of the Cult agenda for the world and the nature of our\\ncollective reality that I will explore later. Cult ‘illumination’ is\\nsymbolised by the torch held by the Statue of Liberty which was\\ngi\\x00ed to New York by French Freemasons in Paris who knew exactly\\nwhat it represents. ‘Liberty’ symbolises the goddess worshipped in Babylon as Queen Semiramis or Ishtar. The signiﬁcance of this will\\nbecome clear. Notice again the ubiquitous theme of inversion with\\nthe Statue of ‘Liberty’ really symbolising mass control (Fig 7). A\\nmirror-image statute stands on an island in the River Seine in Paris\\nfrom where New York Liberty originated (Fig 8). A large replica of\\nthe Liberty ﬂame stands on top of the Pont de l’Alma tunnel in Paris\\nwhere Princess Diana died in a Cult ritual described in The Biggest\\nSecret. Lucifer ‘the light bringer’ is related to all this (and much more\\nas we’ll see) and ‘Lucifer’ is a central ﬁgure in Sabbatian-Frankism\\nand its associated Satanism. Sabbatians reject the Jewish Torah, or\\nPentateuch, the ‘ﬁve books of Moses’ in the Old Testament known as\\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy which are\\nclaimed by Judaism and Christianity to have been dictated by ‘God’\\nto Moses on Mount Sinai. Sabbatians say these do not apply to them\\nand they seek to replace them with the Zohar to absorb Judaism and\\nits followers into their inversion which is an expression of a much\\ngreater global inversion. They want to delete all religions and force\\nhumanity to worship a one-world religion – Sabbatian Satanism that\\nalso includes worship of the Earth goddess. Satanic themes are being\\nmore and more introduced into mainstream society and while\\nChristianity is currently the foremost target for destruction the\\nothers are planned to follow.\\nFigure 7: The Cult goddess of Babylon disguised as the Statue of Liberty holding the flame of\\nLucifer the ‘light bringer’. Figure 8: Liberty’s mirror image in Paris where the New York version originated.\\nMarx brothers\\nRabbi Marvin Antelman connects the Illuminati to the Jacobins in To\\nEliminate the Opiate and Jacobins were the force behind the French\\nRevolution. He links both to the Bund der Gerechten, or League of\\nthe Just, which was the network that inﬂicted communism/Marxism\\non the world. Antelman wrote:\\nThe original inner circle of the Bund der Gerechten consisted of born Catholics, Protestants\\nand Jews [Sabbatian-Frankist infiltrators], and those representatives of respective subdivisions\\nformulated schemes for the ultimate destruction of their faiths. The heretical Catholics laid\\nplans which they felt would take a century or more for the ultimate destruction of the church;\\nthe apostate Jews for the ultimate destruction of the Jewish religion.\\nSabbatian-created communism connects into this anti-religion\\nagenda in that communism does not allow for the free practice of\\nreligion. The Sabbatian ‘Bund’ became the International Communist\\nParty and Communist League and in 1848 ‘Marxism’ was born with\\nthe Communist Manifesto of Sabbatian assets Karl Marx and\\nFriedrich Engels. It is absolutely no coincidence that Marxism, just a\\ndiﬀerent name for fascist and other centrally-controlled tyrannies, is\\nbeing imposed worldwide as a result of the ‘Covid’ hoax and nor\\nthat Marxist/fascist China was the place where the hoax originated.\\nThe reason for this will become very clear in the chapter ‘Covid: The\\ncalculated catastrophe’. The so-called ‘Woke’ mentality has hĳacked traditional beliefs of the political le\\x00 and replaced them with far-\\nright make-believe ‘social justice’ be\\x00er known as Marxism. Woke\\nwill, however, be swallowed by its own perceived ‘revolution’ which\\nis really the work of billionaires and billionaire corporations feigning\\nbeing ‘Woke’. Marxism is being touted by Wokers as a replacement\\nfor ‘capitalism’ when we don’t have ‘capitalism’. We have cartelism\\nin which the market is stitched up by the very Cult billionaires and\\ncorporations bankrolling Woke. Billionaires love Marxism which\\nkeeps the people in servitude while they control from the top.\\nTerminally naïve Wokers think they are ‘changing the world’ when\\nit’s the Cult that is doing the changing and when they have played\\ntheir vital part and become surplus to requirements they, too, will be\\ntargeted. The Illuminati-Jacobins were behind the period known as\\n‘The Terror’ in the French Revolution in 1793 and 1794 when Jacobin\\nMaximillian de Robespierre and his Orwellian ‘Commi\\x00ee of Public\\nSafety’ killed 17,000 ‘enemies of the Revolution’ who had once been\\n‘friends of the Revolution’. Karl Marx (1818-1883), whose Sabbatian\\ncreed of Marxism has cost the lives of at least 100 million people, is a\\nhero once again to Wokers who have been systematically kept\\nignorant of real history by their ‘education’ programming. As a\\nresult they now promote a Sabbatian ‘Marxist’ abomination destined\\nat some point to consume them. Rabbi Antelman, who spent decades\\nresearching the Sabbatian plot, said of the League of the Just and\\nKarl Marx:\\nContrary to popular opinion Karl Marx did not originate the Communist Manifesto. He was\\npaid for his services by the League of the Just, which was known in its country of origin,\\nGermany, as the Bund der Geaechteten.\\nAntelman said the text a\\x00ributed to Marx was the work of other\\npeople and Marx ‘was only repeating what others already said’.\\nMarx was ‘a hired hack – lackey of the wealthy Illuminists’. Marx\\nfamously said that religion was the ‘opium of the people’ (part of the\\nSabbatian plan to demonise religion) and Antelman called his books,\\nTo Eliminate the Opiate. Marx was born Jewish, but his family\\nconverted to Christianity (Sabbatian modus operandi) and he a\\x00acked Jews, not least in his book, A World Without Jews. In doing\\nso he supported the Sabbatian plan to destroy traditional Jewishness\\nand Judaism which we are clearly seeing today with the vindictive\\ntargeting of orthodox Jews by the Sabbatian government of Israel\\nover ‘Covid’ laws. I don’t follow any religion and it has done much\\ndamage to the world over centuries and acted as a perceptual\\nstraightjacket. Renegade Minds, however, are always asking why\\nsomething is being done. It doesn’t ma\\x00er if they agree or disagree\\nwith what is happening – why is it happening is the question. The\\n‘why?’ can be answered with regard to religion in that religions\\ncreate interacting communities of believers when the Cult wants to\\ndismantle all discourse, unity and interaction (see ‘Covid’\\nlockdowns) and the ultimate goal is to delete all religions for a one-\\nworld religion of Cult Satanism worshipping their ‘god’ of which\\nmore later. We see the same ‘why?’ with gun control in America. I\\ndon’t have guns and don’t want them, but why is the Cult seeking to\\ndisarm the population at the same time that law enforcement\\nagencies are armed to their molars and why has every tyrant in\\nhistory sought to disarm people before launching the ﬁnal takeover?\\nThey include Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and Mao who followed\\nconﬁscation with violent seizing of power. You know it’s a Cult\\nagenda by the people who immediately race to the microphones to\\nexploit dead people in multiple shootings. Ultra-Zionist Cult lackey\\nSenator Chuck Schumer was straight on the case a\\x00er ten people\\nwere killed in Boulder, Colorado in March, 2121. Simple rule … if\\nSchumer wants it the Cult wants it and the same with his ultra-\\nZionist mate the wild-eyed Senator Adam Schiﬀ. At the same time\\nthey were calling for the disarmament of Americans, many of whom\\nlive a long way from a police response, Schumer, Schiﬀ and the rest\\nof these pampered clowns were si\\x00ing on Capitol Hill behind a\\nrazor-wired security fence protected by thousands of armed troops\\nin addition to their own armed bodyguards. Mom and pop in an\\nisolated home? They’re just potential mass shooters.\\nZion Mainframe Sabbatian-Frankists and most importantly the Rothschilds were\\nbehind the creation of ‘Zionism’, a political movement that\\ndemanded a Jewish homeland in Israel as promised by Sabbatai\\nZevi. The very symbol of Israel comes from the German meaning of\\nthe name Rothschild. Dynasty founder Mayer Amschel Rothschild\\nchanged the family name from Bauer to Rothschild, or ‘Red-Shield’\\nin German, in deference to the six-pointed ‘Star of David’ hexagram\\ndisplayed on the family’s home in Frankfurt. The symbol later\\nappeared on the ﬂag of Israel a\\x00er the Rothschilds were centrally\\ninvolved in its creation. Hexagrams are not a uniquely Jewish\\nsymbol and are widely used in occult (‘hidden’) networks o\\x00en as a\\nsymbol for Saturn (see my other books for why). Neither are\\nZionism and Jewishness interchangeable. Zionism is a political\\nmovement and philosophy and not a ‘race’ or a people. Many Jews\\noppose Zionism and many non-Jews, including US President Joe\\nBiden, call themselves Zionists as does Israel-centric Donald Trump.\\nAmerica’s support for the Israel government is pre\\x00y much a gimme\\nwith ultra-Zionist billionaires and corporations providing fantastic\\nand dominant funding for both political parties. Former\\nCongresswoman Cynthia McKinney has told how she was\\napproached immediately she ran for oﬃce to ‘sign the pledge’ to\\nIsrael and conﬁrm that she would always vote in that country’s best\\ninterests. All American politicians are approached in this way.\\nAnyone who refuses will get no support or funding from the\\nenormous and all-powerful Zionist lobby that includes organisations\\nlike mega-lobby group AIPAC, the American Israel Public Aﬀairs\\nCommi\\x00ee. Trump’s biggest funder was ultra-Zionist casino and\\nmedia billionaire Sheldon Adelson while major funders of the\\nDemocratic Party include ultra-Zionist George Soros and ultra-\\nZionist ﬁnancial and media mogul, Haim Saban. Some may reel back\\nat the suggestion that Soros is an Israel-ﬁrster (Sabbatian-controlled\\nIsrael-ﬁrster), but Renegade Minds watch the actions not the words\\nand everywhere Soros donates his billions the Sabbatian agenda\\nbeneﬁts. In the spirit of Sabbatian inversion Soros pledged $1 billion\\nfor a new university network to promote ‘liberal values and tackle\\nintolerance’. He made the announcement during his annual speech at the Cult-owned World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in\\nJanuary, 2020, a\\x00er his ‘harsh criticism’ of ‘authoritarian rulers’\\naround the world. You can only laugh at such brazen mendacity.\\nHow he doesn’t laugh is the mystery. Translated from the Orwellian\\n‘liberal values and tackle intolerance’ means teaching non-white\\npeople to hate white people and for white people to loathe\\nthemselves for being born white. The reason for that will become\\nclear.\\nThe ‘Anti-Semitism’ fraud\\nZionists support the Jewish homeland in the land of Palestine which\\nhas been the Sabbatian-Rothschild goal for so long, but not for the\\nbeneﬁt of Jews. Sabbatians and their global Anti-Semitism Industry\\nhave skewed public and political opinion to equate opposing the\\nviolent extremes of Zionism to be a blanket a\\x00ack and condemnation\\nof all Jewish people. Sabbatians and their global Anti-Semitism\\nIndustry have skewed public and political opinion to equate\\nopposing the violent extremes of Zionism to be a blanket a\\x00ack and\\ncondemnation of all Jewish people. This is nothing more than a\\nSabbatian protection racket to stop legitimate investigation and\\nexposure of their agendas and activities. The oﬃcial deﬁnition of\\n‘anti-Semitism’ has more recently been expanded to include criticism\\nof Zionism – a political movement – and this was done to further stop\\nexposure of Sabbatian inﬁltrators who created Zionism as we know\\nit today in the 19th century. Renegade Minds will talk about these\\nsubjects when they know the shit that will come their way. People\\nmust decide if they want to know the truth or just cower in the\\ncorner in fear of what others will say. Sabbatians have been trying to\\nlabel me as ‘anti-Semitic’ since the 1990s as I have uncovered more\\nand more about their background and agendas. Useless, gutless,\\nfraudulent ‘journalists’ then just repeat the smears without question\\nand on the day I was writing this section a pair of unquestioning\\nrepeaters called Ben Quinn and Archie Bland (how appropriate)\\noutright called me an ‘anti-Semite’ in the establishment propaganda\\nsheet, the London Guardian, with no supporting evidence. The Sabbatian Anti-Semitism Industry said so and who are they to\\nquestion that? They wouldn’t dare. Ironically ‘Semitic’ refers to a\\ngroup of languages in the Middle East that are almost entirely\\nArabic. ‘Anti-Semitism’ becomes ‘anti-Arab’ which if the\\nconsequences of this misunderstanding were not so grave would be\\nhilarious. Don’t bother telling Quinn and Bland. I don’t want to\\nconfuse them, bless ‘em. One reason I am dubbed ‘anti-Semitic’ is\\nthat I wrote in the 1990s that Jewish operatives (Sabbatians) were\\nheavily involved in the Russian Revolution when Sabbatians\\noverthrew the Romanov dynasty. This apparently made me ‘anti-\\nSemitic’. Oh, really? Here is a section from The Trigger:\\nBritish journalist Robert Wilton confirmed these themes in his 1920 book The Last Days of the\\nRomanovs when he studied official documents from the Russian government to identify the\\nmembers of the Bolshevik ruling elite between 1917 and 1919. The Central Committee\\nincluded 41 Jews among 62 members; the Council of the People’s Commissars had 17 Jews\\nout of 22 members; and 458 of the 556 most important Bolshevik positions between 1918 and\\n1919 were occupied by Jewish people. Only 17 were Russian. Then there were the 23 Jews\\namong the 36 members of the vicious Cheka Soviet secret police established in 1917 who\\nwould soon appear all across the country.\\nProfessor Robert Service of Oxford University, an expert on 20th century Russian history,\\nfound evidence that [‘Jewish’] Leon Trotsky had sought to make sure that Jews were enrolled\\nin the Red Army and were disproportionately represented in the Soviet civil bureaucracy that\\nincluded the Cheka which performed mass arrests, imprisonment and executions of ‘enemies\\nof the people’. A US State Department Decimal File (861.00/5339) dated November 13th,\\n1918, names [Rothschild banking agent in America] Jacob Schiff and a list of ultra-Zionists as\\nfunders of the Russian Revolution leading to claims of a ‘Jewish plot’, but the key point missed\\nby all is they were not ‘Jews’ – they were Sabbatian-Frankists.\\nBritain’s Winston Churchill made the same error by mistake or\\notherwise. He wrote in a 1920 edition of the Illustrated Sunday Herald\\nthat those behind the Russian revolution were part of a ‘worldwide\\nconspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the\\nreconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of\\nenvious malevolence, and impossible equality’ (see ‘Woke’ today\\nbecause that has been created by the same network). Churchill said\\nthere was no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of\\nBolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution ‘by these international and for the most part atheistical\\nJews’ [‘atheistical Jews’ = Sabbatians]. Churchill said it is certainly a\\nvery great one and probably outweighs all others: ‘With the notable\\nexception of Lenin, the majority of the leading ﬁgures are Jews.’ He\\nwent on to describe, knowingly or not, the Sabbatian modus\\noperandi of placing puppet leaders nominally in power while they\\ncontrol from the background:\\nMoreover, the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus\\nTchitcherin, a pure Russian, is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate, Litvinoff, and the\\ninfluence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of\\nTrotsky, or of Zinovieff, the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd), or of Krassin or Radek – all\\nJews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the\\nprominent, if not indeed the principal, part in the system of terrorism applied by the\\nExtraordinary Commissions for Combatting Counter-Revolution has been taken by Jews, and\\nin some notable cases by Jewesses.\\nWhat I said about seriously disproportionate involvement in the\\nRussian Revolution by Jewish ‘revolutionaries’ (Sabbatians) is\\nprovable fact, but truth is no defence against the Sabbatian Anti-\\nSemitism Industry, its repeater parrots like Quinn and Bland, and\\nthe now breathtaking network of so-called ‘Woke’ ‘anti-hate’ groups\\nwith interlocking leaderships and funding which have the role of\\ndiscrediting and silencing anyone who gets too close to exposing the\\nSabbatians. We have seen ‘truth is no defence’ conﬁrmed in legal\\njudgements with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission in\\nCanada decreeing this: ‘Truthful statements can be presented in a\\nmanner that would meet the deﬁnition of hate speech, and not all\\ntruthful statements must be free from restriction.’ Most ‘anti-hate’\\nactivists, who are themselves consumed by hatred, are too stupid\\nand ignorant of the world to know how they are being used. They\\nare far too far up their own virtue-signalling arses and it’s far too\\ndark for them to see anything.\\nThe ‘revolution’ game\\nThe background and methods of the ‘Russian’ Revolution are\\nstraight from the Sabbatian playbook seen in the French Revolution and endless others around the world that appear to start as a\\nrevolution of the people against tyrannical rule and end up with a\\nregime change to more tyrannical rule overtly or covertly. Wars,\\nterror a\\x00acks and regime overthrows follow the Sabbatian cult\\nthrough history with its agents creating them as Problem-Reaction-\\nSolutions to remove opposition on the road to world domination.\\nSabbatian dots connect the Rothschilds with the Illuminati, Jacobins\\nof the French Revolution, the ‘Bund’ or League of the Just, the\\nInternational Communist Party, Communist League and the\\nCommunist Manifesto of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels that would\\nlead to the Rothschild-funded Russian Revolution. The sequence\\ncomes under the heading of ‘creative destruction’ when you advance\\nto your global goal by continually destroying the status quo to install\\na new status quo which you then also destroy. The two world wars\\ncome to mind. With each new status quo you move closer to your\\nplanned outcome. Wars and mass murder are to Sabbatians a\\ncollective blood sacriﬁce ritual. They are obsessed with death for\\nmany reasons and one is that death is an inversion of life. Satanists\\nand Sabbatians are obsessed with death and o\\x00en target churches\\nand churchyards for their rituals. Inversion-obsessed Sabbatians\\nexplain the use of inverted symbolism including the inverted\\npentagram and inverted cross. The inversion of the cross has been\\nrelated to targeting Christianity, but the cross was a religious symbol\\nlong before Christianity and its inversion is a statement about the\\nSabbatian mentality and goals more than any single religion.\\nSabbatians operating in Germany were behind the rise of the\\noccult-obsessed Nazis and the subsequent Jewish exodus from\\nGermany and Europe to Palestine and the United States a\\x00er World\\nWar Two. The Rothschild dynasty was at the forefront of this both as\\npolitical manipulators and by funding the operation. Why would\\nSabbatians help to orchestrate the horrors inﬂicted on Jews by the\\nNazis and by Stalin a\\x00er they organised the Russian Revolution?\\nSabbatians hate Jews and their religion, that’s why. They pose as\\nJews and secure positions of control within Jewish society and play\\nthe ‘anti-Semitism’ card to protect themselves from exposure through a global network of organisations answering to the\\nSabbatian-created-and-controlled globe-spanning intelligence\\nnetwork that involves a stunning web of military-intelligence\\noperatives and operations for a tiny country of just nine million.\\nAmong them are Jewish assets who are not Sabbatians but have been\\nconvinced by them that what they are doing is for the good of Israel\\nand the Jewish community to protect them from what they have\\nbeen programmed since childhood to believe is a Jew-hating hostile\\nworld. The Jewish community is just a highly convenient cover to\\nhide the true nature of Sabbatians. Anyone ge\\x00ing close to exposing\\ntheir game is accused by Sabbatian place-people and gofers of ‘anti-\\nSemitism’ and claiming that all Jews are part of a plot to take over\\nthe world. I am not saying that. I am saying that Sabbatians – the real\\nJew-haters – have inﬁltrated the Jewish community to use them both\\nas a cover and an ‘anti-Semitic’ defence against exposure. Thus we\\nhave the Anti-Semitism Industry targeted researchers in this way\\nand most Jewish people think this is justiﬁed and genuine. They\\ndon’t know that their ‘Jewish’ leaders and institutions of state,\\nintelligence and military are not controlled by Jews at all, but cultists\\nand stooges of Sabbatian-Frankism. I once added my name to a pro-\\nJewish freedom petition online and the next time I looked my name\\nwas gone and text had been added to the petition blurb to a\\x00ack me\\nas an ‘anti-Semite’ such is the scale of perceptual programming.\\nMoving on America\\nI tell the story in The Trigger and a chapter called ‘Atlantic Crossing’\\nhow particularly a\\x00er Israel was established the Sabbatians moved\\nin on the United States and eventually grasped control of\\ngovernment administration, the political system via both Democrats\\nand Republicans, the intelligence community like the CIA and\\nNational Security Agency (NSA), the Pentagon and mass media.\\nThrough this seriously compartmentalised network Sabbatians and\\ntheir operatives in Mossad, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and US\\nagencies pulled oﬀ 9/11 and blamed it on 19 ‘Al-Qaeda hĳackers’\\ndominated by men from, or connected to, Sabbatian-ruled Saudi Arabia. The ‘19’ were not even on the planes let alone ﬂew those big\\npassenger jets into buildings while being largely incompetent at\\npiloting one-engine light aircra\\x00. ‘Hĳacker’ Hani Hanjour who is\\nsaid to have ﬂown American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon\\nwith a turn and manoeuvre most professional pilots said they would\\nhave struggled to do was banned from renting a small plane by\\ninstructors at the Freeway Airport in Bowie, Maryland, just six weeks\\nearlier on the grounds that he was an incompetent pilot. The Jewish\\npopulation of the world is just 0.2 percent with even that almost\\nentirely concentrated in Israel (75 percent Jewish) and the United\\nStates (around two percent). This two percent and globally 0.2\\npercent refers to Jewish people and not Sabbatian interlopers who are\\na fraction of that fraction. What a sobering thought when you think\\nof the fantastic inﬂuence on world aﬀairs of tiny Israel and that the\\nProject for the New America Century (PNAC) which laid out the\\nblueprint in September, 2000, for America’s war on terror and regime\\nchange wars in Iraq, Libya and Syria was founded and dominated by\\nSabbatians known as ‘Neocons’. The document conceded that this\\nplan would not be supported politically or publicly without a major\\na\\x00ack on American soil and a Problem-Reaction-Solution excuse to\\nsend troops to war across the Middle East. Sabbatian Neocons said:\\n... [The] process of transformation ... [war and regime change] ... is likely to be a long one,\\nabsent some catastrophic and catalysing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.\\nFour months later many of those who produced that document\\ncame to power with their inane puppet George Bush from the long-\\ntime Sabbatian Bush family. They included Sabbatian Dick Cheney\\nwho was oﬃcially vice-president, but really de-facto president for\\nthe entirety of the ‘Bush’ government. Nine months a\\x00er the ‘Bush’\\ninauguration came what Bush called at the time ‘the Pearl Harbor of\\nthe 21st century’ and with typical Sabbatian timing and symbolism\\n2001 was the 60th anniversary of the a\\x00ack in 1941 by the Japanese\\nAir Force on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, which allowed President\\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt to take the United States into a Sabbatian- instigated Second World War that he said in his election campaign\\nthat he never would. The evidence is overwhelming that Roosevelt\\nand his military and intelligence networks knew the a\\x00ack was\\ncoming and did nothing to stop it, but they did make sure that\\nAmerica’s most essential naval ships were not in Hawaii at the time.\\nThree thousand Americans died in the Pearl Harbor a\\x00acks as they\\ndid on September 11th. By the 9/11 year of 2001 Sabbatians had\\nwidely inﬁltrated the US government, military and intelligence\\noperations and used their compartmentalised assets to pull oﬀ the\\n‘Al-Qaeda’ a\\x00acks. If you read The Trigger it will blow your mind to\\nsee the u\\x00erly staggering concentration of ‘Jewish’ operatives\\n(Sabbatian inﬁltrators) in essential positions of political, security,\\nlegal, law enforcement, ﬁnancial and business power before, during,\\nand a\\x00er the a\\x00acks to make them happen, carry them out, and then\\ncover their tracks – and I do mean staggering when you think of that\\n0.2 percent of the world population and two percent of Americans\\nwhich are Jewish while Sabbatian inﬁltrators are a fraction of that. A\\ncentral foundation of the 9/11 conspiracy was the hĳacking of\\ngovernment, military, Air Force and intelligence computer systems\\nin real time through ‘back-door’ access made possible by Israeli\\n(Sabbatian) ‘cyber security’ so\\x00ware. Sabbatian-controlled Israel is\\non the way to rivalling Silicon Valley for domination of cyberspace\\nand is becoming the dominant force in cyber-security which gives\\nthem access to entire computer systems and their passcodes across\\nthe world. Then add to this that Zionists head (oﬃcially) Silicon\\nValley giants like Google (Larry Page and Sergey Brin), Google-\\nowned YouTube (Susan Wojcicki), Facebook (Mark Zuckerberg and\\nSheryl Sandberg), and Apple (Chairman Arthur D. Levinson), and\\nthat ultra-Zionist hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer has a $1 billion\\nstake in Twi\\x00er which is only nominally headed by ‘CEO’ pothead\\nJack Dorsey. As cable news host Tucker Carlson said of Dorsey:\\n‘There used to be debate in the medical community whether\\ndropping a ton of acid had permanent eﬀects and I think that debate\\nhas now ended.’ Carlson made the comment a\\x00er Dorsey told a\\nhearing on Capitol Hill (if you cut through his bullshit) that he believed in free speech so long as he got to decide what you can hear\\nand see. These ‘big names’ of Silicon Valley are only front men and\\nwomen for the Global Cult, not least the Sabbatians, who are the true\\ncontrollers of these corporations. Does anyone still wonder why\\nthese same people and companies have been ferociously censoring\\nand banning people (like me) for exposing any aspect of the Cult\\nagenda and especially the truth about the ‘Covid’ hoax which\\nSabbatians have orchestrated?\\nThe Jeﬀrey Epstein paedophile ring was a Sabbatian operation. He\\nwas oﬃcially ‘Jewish’ but he was a Sabbatian and women abused by\\nthe ring have told me about the high number of ‘Jewish’ people\\ninvolved. The Epstein horror has Sabbatian wri\\x00en all over it and\\nmatches perfectly their modus operandi and obsession with sex and\\nritual. Epstein was running a Sabbatian blackmail ring in which\\nfamous people with political and other inﬂuence were provided\\nwith young girls for sex while everything was being ﬁlmed and\\nrecorded on hidden cameras and microphones at his New York\\nhouse, Caribbean island and other properties. Epstein survivors\\nhave described this surveillance system to me and some have gone\\npublic. Once the famous politician or other ﬁgure knew he or she\\nwas on video they tended to do whatever they were told. Here we go\\nagain …when you’ve got them by the balls their hearts and minds\\nwill follow. Sabbatians use this blackmail technique on a wide scale\\nacross the world to entrap politicians and others they need to act as\\ndemanded. Epstein’s private plane, the infamous ‘Lolita Express’,\\nhad many well-known passengers including Bill Clinton while Bill\\nGates has ﬂown on an Epstein plane and met with him four years\\na\\x00er Epstein had been jailed for paedophilia. They subsequently met\\nmany times at Epstein’s home in New York according to a witness\\nwho was there. Epstein’s infamous side-kick was Ghislaine Maxwell,\\ndaughter of Mossad agent and ultra-Zionist mega-crooked British\\nbusinessman, Bob Maxwell, who at one time owned the Daily Mirror\\nnewspaper. Maxwell was murdered at sea on his boat in 1991 by\\nSabbatian-controlled Mossad when he became a liability with his business empire collapsing as a former Mossad operative has\\nconﬁrmed (see The Trigger).\\nMoney, money, money, funny money …\\nBefore I come to the Sabbatian connection with the last three US\\npresidents I will lay out the crucial importance to Sabbatians of\\ncontrolling banking and ﬁnance. Sabbatian Mayer Amschel\\nRothschild set out to dominate this arena in his family’s quest for\\ntotal global control. What is freedom? It is, in eﬀect, choice. The\\nmore choices you have the freer you are and the fewer your choices\\nthe more you are enslaved. In the global structure created over\\ncenturies by Sabbatians the biggest decider and restrictor of choice is\\n… money. Across the world if you ask people what they would like\\nto do with their lives and why they are not doing that they will reply\\n‘I don’t have the money’. This is the idea. A global elite of multi-\\nbillionaires are described as ‘greedy’ and that is true on one level;\\nbut control of money – who has it and who doesn’t – is not primarily\\nabout greed. It’s about control. Sabbatians have seized ever more\\ncontrol of ﬁnance and sucked the wealth of the world out of the\\nhands of the population. We talk now, a\\x00er all, about the ‘One-\\npercent’ and even then the wealthiest are a lot fewer even than that.\\nThis has been made possible by a money scam so outrageous and so\\nvast it could rightly be called the scam of scams founded on creating\\n‘money’ out of nothing and ‘loaning’ that with interest to the\\npopulation. Money out of nothing is called ‘credit’. Sabbatians have\\nasserted control over governments and banking ever more\\ncompletely through the centuries and secured ﬁnancial laws that\\nallow banks to lend hugely more than they have on deposit in a\\nconﬁdence trick known as fractional reserve lending. Imagine if you\\ncould lend money that doesn’t exist and charge the recipient interest\\nfor doing so. You would end up in jail. Bankers by contrast end up in\\nmansions, private jets, Malibu and Monaco.\\nBanks are only required to keep a fraction of their deposits and\\nwealth in their vaults and they are allowed to lend ‘money’ they\\ndon’t have called ‘credit. Go into a bank for a loan and if you succeed the banker will not move any real wealth into your account. They\\nwill type into your account the amount of the agreed ‘loan’ – say\\n£100,000. This is not wealth that really exists; it is non-existent, fresh-\\nair, created-out-of-nothing ‘credit’ which has never, does not, and\\nwill never exist except in theory. Credit is backed by nothing except\\nwind and only has buying power because people think that it has\\nbuying power and accept it in return for property, goods and\\nservices. I have described this situation as like those cartoon\\ncharacters you see chasing each other and when they run over the\\nedge of a cliﬀ they keep running forward on fresh air until one of\\nthem looks down, realises what’s happened, and they all crash into\\nthe ravine. The whole foundation of the Sabbatian ﬁnancial system is\\nto stop people looking down except for periodic moments when they\\nwant to crash the system (as in 2008 and 2020 ongoing) and reap the\\nrewards from all the property, businesses and wealth their borrowers\\nhad signed over as ‘collateral’ in return for a ‘loan’ of fresh air. Most\\npeople think that money is somehow created by governments when\\nit comes into existence from the start as a debt through banks\\n‘lending’ illusory money called credit. Yes, the very currency of\\nexchange is a debt from day one issued as an interest-bearing loan.\\nWhy don’t governments create money interest-free and lend it to\\ntheir people interest-free? Governments are controlled by Sabbatians\\nand the ﬁnancial system is controlled by Sabbatians for whom\\ninterest-free money would be a nightmare come true. Sabbatians\\nunderpin their ﬁnancial domination through their global network of\\ncentral banks, including the privately-owned US Federal Reserve\\nand Britain’s Bank of England, and this is orchestrated by a\\nprivately-owned central bank coordination body called the Bank for\\nInternational Se\\x00lements in Basle, Switzerland, created by the usual\\nsuspects including the Rockefellers and Rothschilds. Central bank\\nchiefs don’t answer to governments or the people. They answer to\\nthe Bank for International Se\\x00lements or, in other words, the Global\\nCult which is dominated today by Sabbatians.\\nBuilt-in disaster There are so many constituent scams within the overall banking\\nscam. When you take out a loan of thin-air credit only the amount of\\nthat loan is theoretically brought into circulation to add to the\\namount in circulation; but you are paying back the principle plus\\ninterest. The additional interest is not created and this means that\\nwith every ‘loan’ there is a shortfall in the money in circulation\\nbetween what is borrowed and what has to be paid back. There is\\nnever even close to enough money in circulation to repay all\\noutstanding public and private debt including interest. Coldly\\nweaved in the very fabric of the system is the certainty that some\\nwill lose their homes, businesses and possessions to the banking\\n‘lender’. This is less obvious in times of ‘boom’ when the amount of\\nmoney in circulation (and the debt) is expanding through more\\npeople wanting and ge\\x00ing loans. When a downturn comes and the\\nmoney supply contracts it becomes painfully obvious that there is\\nnot enough money to service all debt and interest. This is less\\nobvious in times of ‘boom’ when the amount of money in circulation\\n(and the debt) is expanding through more people wanting and\\nge\\x00ing loans. When a downturn comes and the money supply\\ncontracts and it becomes painfully obvious – as in 2008 and currently\\n– that there is not enough money to service all debt and interest.\\nSabbatian banksters have been leading the human population\\nthrough a calculated series of booms (more debt incurred) and busts\\n(when the debt can’t be repaid and the banks get the debtor’s\\ntangible wealth in exchange for non-existent ‘credit’). With each\\n‘bust’ Sabbatian bankers have absorbed more of the world’s tangible\\nwealth and we end up with the One-percent. Governments are in\\nbankruptcy levels of debt to the same system and are therefore\\nowned by a system they do not control. The Federal Reserve,\\n‘America’s central bank’, is privately-owned and American\\npresidents only nominally appoint its chairman or woman to\\nmaintain the illusion that it’s an arm of government. It’s not. The\\n‘Fed’ is a cartel of private banks which handed billions to its\\nassociates and friends a\\x00er the crash of 2008 and has been Sabbatian-\\ncontrolled since it was manipulated into being in 1913 through the\\ncovert trickery of Rothschild banking agents Jacob Schiﬀ and Paul Warburg, and the Sabbatian Rockefeller family. Somehow from a\\nJewish population of two-percent and globally 0.2 percent (Sabbatian\\ninterlopers remember are far smaller) ultra-Zionists headed the\\nFederal Reserve for 31 years between 1987 and 2018 in the form of\\nAlan Greenspan, Bernard Bernanke and Janet Yellen (now Biden’s\\nTreasury Secretary) with Yellen’s deputy chairman a Israeli-\\nAmerican duel citizen and ultra-Zionist Stanley Fischer, a former\\ngovernor of the Bank of Israel. Ultra-Zionist Fed chiefs spanned the\\npresidencies of Ronald Reagan (‘Republican’), Father George Bush\\n(‘Republican’), Bill Clinton (‘Democrat’), Boy George Bush\\n(‘Republican’) and Barack Obama (‘Democrat’). We should really\\nadd the pre-Greenspan chairman, Paul Adolph Volcker, ‘appointed’\\nby Jimmy Carter (‘Democrat’) who ran the Fed between 1979 and\\n1987 during the Carter and Reagan administrations before\\nGreenspan took over. Volcker was a long-time associate and business\\npartner of the Rothschilds. No ma\\x00er what the ‘party’ oﬃcially in\\npower the United States economy was directed by the same force.\\nHere are members of the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations\\nand see if you can make out a common theme.\\nBarack Obama (‘Democrat’)\\nUltra-Zionists Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner\\nran the US Treasury in the Clinton administration and two of them\\nreappeared with Obama. Ultra-Zionist Fed chairman Alan\\nGreenspan had manipulated the crash of 2008 through deregulation\\nand jumped ship just before the disaster to make way for ultra-\\nZionist Bernard Bernanke to hand out trillions to Sabbatian ‘too big\\nto fail’ banks and businesses, including the ubiquitous ultra-Zionist\\nGoldman Sachs which has an ongoing staﬀ revolving door operation\\nbetween itself and major ﬁnancial positions in government\\nworldwide. Obama inherited the fallout of the crash when he took\\noﬃce in January, 2009, and fortunately he had the support of his\\nultra-Zionist White House Chief of Staﬀ Rahm Emmanuel, son of a\\nterrorist who helped to bomb Israel into being in 1948, and his ultra-\\nZionist senior adviser David Axelrod, chief strategist in Obama’s two successful presidential campaigns. Emmanuel, later mayor of\\nChicago and former senior fundraiser and strategist for Bill Clinton,\\nis an example of the Sabbatian policy a\\x00er Israel was established of\\nmigrating insider families to America so their children would be\\nborn American citizens. ‘Obama’ chose this ﬁnancial team\\nthroughout his administration to respond to the Sabbatian-instigated\\ncrisis:\\nTimothy Geithner (ultra-Zionist) Treasury Secretary; Jacob J. Lew,\\nTreasury Secretary; Larry Summers (ultra-Zionist), director of the\\nWhite House National Economic Council; Paul Adolph Volcker\\n(Rothschild business partner), chairman of the Economic Recovery\\nAdvisory Board; Peter Orszag (ultra-Zionist), director of the Oﬃce of\\nManagement and Budget overseeing all government spending;\\nPenny Pritzker (ultra-Zionist), Commerce Secretary; Jared Bernstein\\n(ultra-Zionist), chief economist and economic policy adviser to Vice\\nPresident Joe Biden; Mary Schapiro (ultra-Zionist), chair of the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Gary Gensler (ultra-\\nZionist), chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\\n(CFTC); Sheila Bair (ultra-Zionist), chair of the Federal Deposit\\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC); Karen Mills (ultra-Zionist), head of\\nthe Small Business Administration (SBA); Kenneth Feinberg (ultra-\\nZionist), Special Master for Executive [bail-out] Compensation.\\nFeinberg would be appointed to oversee compensation (with strings)\\nto 9/11 victims and families in a campaign to stop them having their\\nday in court to question the oﬃcial story. At the same time ultra-\\nZionist Bernard Bernanke was chairman of the Federal Reserve and\\nthese are only some of the ultra-Zionists with allegiance to\\nSabbatian-controlled Israel in the Obama government. Obama’s\\nbiggest corporate donor was ultra-Zionist Goldman Sachs which had\\nemployed many in his administration.\\nDonald Trump (‘Republican’)\\nTrump claimed to be an outsider (he wasn’t) who had come to ‘drain\\nthe swamp’. He embarked on this goal by immediately appointing\\nultra-Zionist Steve Mnuchin, a Goldman Sachs employee for 17 years, as his Treasury Secretary. Others included Gary Cohn (ultra-\\nZionist), chief operating oﬃcer of Goldman Sachs, his ﬁrst Director\\nof the National Economic Council and chief economic adviser, who\\nwas later replaced by Larry Kudlow (ultra-Zionist). Trump’s senior\\nadviser throughout his four years in the White House was his\\nsinister son-in-law Jared Kushner, a life-long friend of Israel Prime\\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu. Kushner is the son of a convicted\\ncrook who was pardoned by Trump in his last days in oﬃce. Other\\nultra-Zionists in the Trump administration included: Stephen Miller,\\nSenior Policy Adviser; Avrahm Berkowitz, Deputy Adviser to Trump\\nand his Senior Adviser Jared Kushner; Ivanka Trump, Adviser to the\\nPresident, who converted to Judaism when she married Jared\\nKushner; David Friedman, Trump lawyer and Ambassador to Israel;\\nJason Greenbla\\x00, Trump Organization executive vice president and\\nchief legal oﬃcer, who was made Special Representative for\\nInternational Negotiations and the Israeli-Palestinian Conﬂict; Rod\\nRosenstein, Deputy A\\x00orney General; Elliot Abrams, Special\\nRepresentative for Venezuela, then Iran; John Eisenberg, National\\nSecurity Council Legal Adviser and Deputy Council to the President\\nfor National Security Aﬀairs; Anne Neuberger, Deputy National\\nManager, National Security Agency; Ezra Cohen-Watnick, Acting\\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Intelligence; Elan Carr, Special Envoy\\nto monitor and combat anti-Semitism; Len Khodorkovsky, Deputy\\nSpecial Envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism; Reed Cordish,\\nAssistant to the President, Intragovernmental and Technology\\nInitiatives. Trump Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State\\nMike Pompeo, both Christian Zionists, were also vehement\\nsupporters of Israel and its goals and ambitions.\\nDonald ‘free-speech believer’ Trump pardoned a number of\\nﬁnancial and violent criminals while ignoring calls to pardon Julian\\nAssange and Edward Snowden whose crimes are revealing highly\\nrelevant information about government manipulation and\\ncorruption and the widespread illegal surveillance of the American\\npeople by US ‘security’ agencies. It’s so good to know that Trump is\\non the side of freedom and justice and not mega-criminals with allegiance to Sabbatian-controlled Israel. These included a pardon\\nfor Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard who was jailed for life in 1987 under\\nthe Espionage Act. Aviem Sella, the Mossad agent who recruited\\nPollard, was also pardoned by Trump while Assange sat in jail and\\nSnowden remained in exile in Russia. Sella had ‘ﬂed’ (was helped to\\nescape) to Israel in 1987 and was never extradited despite being\\ncharged under the Espionage Act. A Trump White House statement\\nsaid that Sella’s clemency had been ‘supported by Benjamin\\nNetanyahu, Ron Dermer, Israel’s US Ambassador, David Friedman,\\nUS Ambassador to Israel and Miriam Adelson, wife of leading\\nTrump donor Sheldon Adelson who died shortly before. Other\\nfriends of Jared Kushner were pardoned along with Sholom Weiss\\nwho was believed to be serving the longest-ever white-collar prison\\nsentence of more than 800 years in 2000. The sentence was\\ncommuted of Ponzi-schemer Eliyahu Weinstein who defrauded Jews\\nand others out of $200 million. I did mention that Assange and\\nSnowden were ignored, right? Trump gave Sabbatians almost\\neverything they asked for in military and political support, moving\\nthe US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with its critical symbolic\\nand literal implications for Palestinian statehood, and the ‘deal of the\\nCentury’ designed by Jared Kushner and David Friedman which\\ngave the Sabbatian Israeli government the green light to\\nsubstantially expand its already widespread program of building\\nillegal Jewish-only se\\x00lements in the occupied land of the West\\nBank. This made a two-state ‘solution’ impossible by seizing all the\\nland of a potential Palestinian homeland and that had been the plan\\nsince 1948 and then 1967 when the Arab-controlled Gaza Strip, West\\nBank, Sinai Peninsula and Syrian Golan Heights were occupied by\\nIsrael. All the talks about talks and road maps and delays have been\\nbuying time until the West Bank was physically occupied by Israeli\\nreal estate. Trump would have to be a monumentally ill-informed\\nidiot not to see that this was the plan he was helping to complete.\\nThe Trump administration was in so many ways the Kushner\\nadministration which means the Netanyahu administration which\\nmeans the Sabbatian administration. I understand why many\\nopposing Cult fascism in all its forms gravitated to Trump, but he was a crucial part of the Sabbatian plan and I will deal with this in\\nthe next chapter.\\nJoe Biden (‘Democrat’)\\nA barely cognitive Joe Biden took over the presidency in January,\\n2021, along with his fellow empty shell, Vice-President Kamala\\nHarris, as the latest Sabbatian gofers to enter the White House.\\nNames on the door may have changed and the ‘party’ – the force\\nbehind them remained the same as Zionists were appointed to a\\nstream of pivotal areas relating to Sabbatian plans and policy. They\\nincluded: Janet Yellen, Treasury Secretary, former head of the Federal\\nReserve, and still another ultra-Zionist running the US Treasury a\\x00er\\nMnuchin (Trump), Lew and Geithner (Obama), and Summers and\\nRubin (Clinton); Anthony Blinken, Secretary of State; Wendy\\nSherman, Deputy Secretary of State (so that’s ‘Biden’s’ Sabbatian\\nforeign policy sorted); Jeﬀ Zients, White House coronavirus\\ncoordinator; Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease\\nControl; Rachel Levine, transgender deputy health secretary (that’s\\n‘Covid’ hoax policy under control); Merrick Garland, A\\x00orney\\nGeneral; Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security; Cass\\nSunstein, Homeland Security with responsibility for new\\nimmigration laws; Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence;\\nAnne Neuberger, National Security Agency cybersecurity director\\n(note, cybersecurity); David Cohen, CIA Deputy Director; Ronald\\nKlain, Biden’s Chief of Staﬀ (see Rahm Emanuel); Eric Lander, a\\n‘leading geneticist’, Oﬃce of Science and Technology Policy director\\n(see Smart Grid, synthetic biology agenda); Jessica Rosenworcel,\\nacting head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\\nwhich controls Smart Grid technology policy and electromagnetic\\ncommunication systems including 5G. How can it be that so many\\npivotal positions are held by two-percent of the American\\npopulation and 0.2 percent of the world population administration\\na\\x00er administration no ma\\x00er who is the president and what is the\\nparty? It’s a coincidence? Of course it’s not and this is why\\nSabbatians have built their colossal global web of interlocking ‘anti- hate’ hate groups to condemn anyone who asks these glaring\\nquestions as an ‘anti-Semite’. The way that Jewish people horriﬁcally\\nabused in Sabbatian-backed Nazi Germany are exploited to this end\\nis stomach-turning and disgusting beyond words.\\nPolitical fusion\\nSabbatian manipulation has reversed the roles of Republicans and\\nDemocrats and the same has happened in Britain with the\\nConservative and Labour Parties. Republicans and Conservatives\\nwere always labelled the ‘right’ and Democrats and Labour the ‘le\\x00’,\\nbut look at the policy positions now and the Democrat-Labour ‘le\\x00’\\nhas moved further to the ‘right’ than Republicans and Conservatives\\nunder the banner of ‘Woke’, the Cult-created far-right tyranny.\\nWhere once the Democrat-Labour ‘le\\x00’ defended free speech and\\nhuman rights they now seek to delete them and as I said earlier\\ndespite the ‘Covid’ fascism of the Jackboot Johnson Conservative\\ngovernment in the UK the Labour Party of leader Keir Starmer\\ndemanded even more extreme measures. The Labour Party has been\\nvery publicly absorbed by Sabbatians a\\x00er a political and media\\nonslaught against the previous leader, the weak and inept Jeremy\\nCorbyn, over made-up allegations of ‘anti-Semitism’ both by him\\nand his party. The plan was clear with this ‘anti-Semite’ propaganda\\nand what was required in response was a swi\\x00 and decisive ‘fuck\\noﬀ’ from Corbyn and a statement to expose the Anti-Semitism\\nIndustry (Sabbatian) a\\x00empt to silence Labour criticism of the Israeli\\ngovernment (Sabbatians) and purge the party of all dissent against\\nthe extremes of ultra-Zionism (Sabbatians). Instead Corbyn and his\\nparty fell to their knees and appeased the abusers which, by\\ndeﬁnition, is impossible. Appeasing one demand leads only to a new\\ndemand to be appeased until takeover is complete. Like I say – ‘fuck\\noﬀ’ would have been a much more eﬀective policy and I have used it\\nmyself with great eﬀect over the years when Sabbatians are on my\\ncase which is most of the time. I consider that fact a great\\ncompliment, by the way. The outcome of the Labour Party\\ncapitulation is that we now have a Sabbatian-controlled Conservative Party ‘opposed’ by a Sabbatian-controlled Labour\\nParty in a one-party Sabbatian state that hurtles towards the\\nextremes of tyranny (the Sabbatian cult agenda). In America the\\nsituation is the same. Labour’s Keir Starmer spends his days on his\\nknees with his tongue out pointing to Tel Aviv, or I guess now\\nJerusalem, while Boris Johnson has an ‘anti-Semitism czar’ in the\\nform of former Labour MP John Mann who keeps Starmer company\\non his prayer mat.\\nSabbatian inﬂuence can be seen in Jewish members of the Labour\\nParty who have been ejected for criticism of Israel including those\\nfrom families that suﬀered in Nazi Germany. Sabbatians despise real\\nJewish people and target them even more harshly because it is so\\nmuch more diﬃcult to dub them ‘anti-Semitic’ although in their\\ndesperation they do try. I\\nCHAPTER THREE\\nThe Pushbacker sting\\nUntil you realize how easy it is for your mind to be manipulated, you\\nremain the puppet of someone else’s game\\nEvita Ochel\\nwill use the presidencies of Trump and Biden to show how the\\nmanipulation of the one-party state plays out behind the illusion\\nof political choice across the world. No two presidencies could – on\\nthe face of it – be more diﬀerent and apparently at odds in terms of\\ndirection and policy.\\nA Renegade Mind sees beyond the obvious and focuses on\\noutcomes and consequences and not image, words and waﬄe. The\\nCult embarked on a campaign to divide America between those who\\nblindly support its agenda (the mentality known as ‘Woke’) and\\nthose who are pushing back on where the Cult and its Sabbatians\\nwant to go. This presents inﬁnite possibilities for dividing and ruling\\nthe population by se\\x00ing them at war with each other and allows a\\nperceptual ring fence of demonisation to encircle the Pushbackers in\\na modern version of the Li\\x00le Big Horn in 1876 when American\\ncavalry led by Lieutenant Colonel George Custer were drawn into a\\ntrap, surrounded and killed by Native American tribes defending\\ntheir land of thousands of years from being seized by the\\ngovernment. In this modern version the roles are reversed and it’s\\nthose defending themselves from the Sabbatian government who are\\nsurrounded and the government that’s seeking to destroy them. This\\ntrap was set years ago and to explain how we must return to 2016 and the emergence of Donald Trump as a candidate to be President\\nof the United States. He set out to overcome the best part of 20 other\\ncandidates in the Republican Party before and during the primaries\\nand was not considered by many in those early stages to have a\\nprayer of living in the White House. The Republican Party was said\\nto have great reservations about Trump and yet somehow he won\\nthe nomination. When you know how American politics works –\\npolitics in general – there is no way that Trump could have become\\nthe party’s candidate unless the Sabbatian-controlled ‘Neocons’ that\\nrun the Republican Party wanted that to happen. We saw the proof\\nin emails and documents made public by WikiLeaks that the\\nDemocratic Party hierarchy, or Democons, systematically\\nundermined the campaign of Bernie Sanders to make sure that\\nSabbatian gofer Hillary Clinton won the nomination to be their\\npresidential candidate. If the Democons could do that then the\\nNeocons in the Republican Party could have derailed Trump in the\\nsame way. But they didn’t and at that stage I began to conclude that\\nTrump could well be the one chosen to be president. If that was the\\ncase the ‘why’ was pre\\x00y clear to see – the goal of dividing America\\nbetween Cult agenda-supporting Wokers and Pushbackers who\\ngravitated to Trump because he was telling them what they wanted\\nto hear. His constituency of support had been increasingly ignored\\nand voiceless for decades and profoundly through the eight years of\\nSabbatian puppet Barack Obama. Now here was someone speaking\\ntheir language of pulling back from the incessant globalisation of\\npolitical and economic power, the exporting of American jobs to\\nChina and elsewhere by ‘American’ (Sabbatian) corporations, the\\ndeletion of free speech, and the mass immigration policies that had\\nfurther devastated job opportunities for the urban working class of\\nall races and the once American heartlands of the Midwest.\\nBeware the forked tongue\\nThose people collectively sighed with relief that at last a political\\nleader was apparently on their side, but another trait of the\\nRenegade Mind is that you look even harder at people telling you what you want to hear than those who are telling you otherwise.\\nObviously as I said earlier people wish what they want to hear to be\\ntrue and genuine and they are much more likely to believe that than\\nsomeone saying what they don’t want to here and don’t want to be\\ntrue. Sales people are taught to be skilled in eliciting by calculated\\nquestioning what their customers want to hear and repeating that\\nback to them as their own opinion to get their targets to like and\\ntrust them. Assets of the Cult are also sales people in the sense of\\nselling perception. To read Cult manipulation you have to play the\\nlong and expanded game and not fall for the Vaudeville show of\\nparty politics. Both American parties are vehicles for the Cult and\\nthey exploit them in diﬀerent ways depending on what the agenda\\nrequires at that moment. Trump and the Republicans were used to\\nbe the focus of dividing America and isolating Pushbackers to open\\nthe way for a Biden presidency to become the most extreme in\\nAmerican history by advancing the full-blown Woke (Cult) agenda\\nwith the aim of destroying and silencing Pushbackers now labelled\\nNazi Trump supporters and white supremacists.\\nSabbatians wanted Trump in oﬃce for the reasons described by\\nultra-Zionist Saul Alinsky (1909-1972) who was promoting the Woke\\nphilosophy through ‘community organising’ long before anyone had\\nheard of it. In those days it still went by its traditional name of\\nMarxism. The reason for the manipulated Trump phenomenon was\\nlaid out in Alinsky’s 1971 book, Rules for Radicals, which was his\\nblueprint for overthrowing democratic and other regimes and\\nreplacing them with Sabbatian Marxism. Not surprisingly his to-do\\nlist was evident in the Sabbatian French and Russian ‘Revolutions’\\nand that in China which will become very relevant in the next\\nchapter about the ‘Covid’ hoax. Among Alinsky’s followers have\\nbeen the deeply corrupt Barack Obama, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\nand Hillary Clinton who described him as a ‘hero’. All three are\\nSabbatian stooges with Pelosi personifying the arrogant corrupt\\nidiocy that so widely fronts up for the Cult inner core. Predictably as\\na Sabbatian advocate of the ‘light-bringer’ Alinsky features Lucifer\\non the dedication page of his book as the original radical who gained his own kingdom (‘Earth’ as we shall see). One of Alinsky’s golden\\nradical rules was to pick an individual and focus all a\\x00ention, hatred\\nand blame on them and not to target faceless bureaucracies and\\ncorporations. Rules for Radicals is really a Sabbatian handbook with\\nits contents repeatedly employed all over the world for centuries and\\nwhy wouldn’t Sabbatians bring to power their designer-villain to be\\nused as the individual on which all a\\x00ention, hatred and blame was\\nbestowed? This is what they did and the only question for me is how\\nmuch Trump knew that and how much he was manipulated. A bit of\\nboth, I suspect. This was Alinsky’s Trump technique from a man\\nwho died in 1972. The technique has spanned history:\\nPick the target, freeze it, personalize it, polarize it. Don’t try to attack abstract corporations or\\nbureaucracies. Identify a responsible individual. Ignore attempts to shift or spread the blame.\\nFrom the moment Trump came to illusory power everything was\\nabout him. It wasn’t about Republican policy or opinion, but all\\nabout Trump. Everything he did was presented in negative,\\nderogatory and abusive terms by the Sabbatian-dominated media\\nled by Cult operations such as CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times\\nand the Jeﬀ Bezos-owned Washington Post – ‘Pick the target, freeze it,\\npersonalize it, polarize it.’ Trump was turned into a demon to be\\nviliﬁed by those who hated him and a demi-god loved by those who\\nworshipped him. This, in turn, had his supporters, too, presented as\\nequally demonic in preparation for the punchline later down the line\\nwhen Biden was about to take oﬃce. It was here’s a Trump, there’s a\\nTrump, everywhere a Trump, Trump. Virtually every news story or\\nhappening was ﬁltered through the lens of ‘The Donald’. You loved\\nhim or hated him and which one you chose was said to deﬁne you as\\nSatan’s spawn or a paragon of virtue. Even supporting some Trump\\npolicies or statements and not others was enough for an assault on\\nyour character. No shades of grey were or are allowed. Everything is\\nblack and white (literally and ﬁguratively). A Californian I knew had\\nher head u\\x00erly scrambled by her hatred for Trump while telling\\npeople they should love each other. She was so totally consumed by Trump Derangement Syndrome as it became to be known that this\\nglaring contradiction would never have occurred to her. By\\ndeﬁnition anyone who criticised Trump or praised his opponents\\nwas a hero and this lady described Joe Biden as ‘a kind, honest\\ngentleman’ when he’s a provable liar, mega-crook and vicious piece\\nof work to boot. Sabbatians had indeed divided America using\\nTrump as the fall-guy and all along the clock was ticking on the\\nconsequences for his supporters.\\nIn hock to his masters\\nTrump gave Sabbatians via Israel almost everything they wanted in\\nhis four years. Ask and you shall receive was the dynamic between\\nhimself and Benjamin Netanyahu orchestrated by Trump’s ultra-\\nZionist son-in-law Jared Kushner, his ultra-Zionist Ambassador to\\nIsrael, David Friedman, and ultra-Zionist ‘Israel adviser’, Jason\\nGreenbla\\x00. The last two were central to the running and protecting\\nfrom collapse of his business empire, the Trump Organisation, and\\ncolossal business failures made him forever beholding to Sabbatian\\nnetworks that bailed him out. By the start of the 1990s Trump owed\\n$4 billion to banks that he couldn’t pay and almost $1billion of that\\nwas down to him personally and not his companies. This mega-\\ndisaster was the result of building two new casinos in Atlantic City\\nand buying the enormous Taj Mahal operation which led to\\ncrippling debt payments. He had borrowed fantastic sums from 72\\nbanks with major Sabbatian connections and although the scale of\\ndebt should have had him living in a tent alongside the highway\\nthey never foreclosed. A plan was devised to li\\x00 Trump from the\\nmire by BT Securities Corporation and Rothschild Inc. and the case\\nwas handled by Wilber Ross who had worked for the Rothschilds for\\n27 years. Ross would be named US Commerce Secretary a\\x00er\\nTrump’s election. Another crucial ﬁgure in saving Trump was ultra-\\nZionist ‘investor’ Carl Icahn who bought the Taj Mahal casino. Icahn\\nwas made special economic adviser on ﬁnancial regulation in the\\nTrump administration. He didn’t stay long but still managed to ﬁnd\\ntime to make a tidy sum of a reported $31.3 million when he sold his holdings aﬀected by the price of steel three days before Trump\\nimposed a 235 percent tariﬀ on steel imports. What amazing bits of\\nluck these people have. Trump and Sabbatian operatives have long\\nhad a close association and his mentor and legal adviser from the\\nearly 1970s until 1986 was the dark and genetically corrupt ultra-\\nZionist Roy Cohn who was chief counsel to Senator Joseph\\nMcCarthy’s ‘communist’ witch-hunt in the 1950s. Esquire magazine\\npublished an article about Cohn with the headline ‘Don’t mess with\\nRoy Cohn’. He was described as the most feared lawyer in New York\\nand ‘a ruthless master of dirty tricks ... [with] ... more than one Maﬁa\\nDon on speed dial’. Cohn’s inﬂuence, contacts, support and\\nprotection made Trump a front man for Sabbatians in New York\\nwith their connections to one of Cohn’s many criminal employers,\\nthe ‘Russian’ Sabbatian Maﬁa. Israel-centric media mogul Rupert\\nMurdoch was introduced to Trump by Cohn and they started a long\\nfriendship. Cohn died in 1986 weeks a\\x00er being disbarred for\\nunethical conduct by the Appellate Division of the New York State\\nSupreme Court. The wheels of justice do indeed run slow given the\\nlength of Cohn’s crooked career.\\nQAnon-sense\\nWe are asked to believe that Donald Trump with his fundamental\\nconnections to Sabbatian networks and operatives has been leading\\nthe ﬁght to stop the Sabbatian agenda for the fascistic control of\\nAmerica and the world. Sure he has. A man entrapped during his\\nyears in the White House by Sabbatian operatives and whose biggest\\nﬁnancial donor was casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson who was\\nSabbatian to his DNA?? Oh, do come on. Trump has been used to\\ndivide America and isolate Pushbackers on the Cult agenda under\\nthe heading of ‘Trump supporters’, ‘insurrectionists’ and ‘white\\nsupremacists’. The US Intelligence/Mossad Psyop or psychological\\noperation known as QAnon emerged during the Trump years as a\\ncentral pillar in the Sabbatian campaign to lead Pushbackers into the\\ntrap set by those that wished to destroy them. I knew from the start\\nthat QAnon was a scam because I had seen the same scenario many times before over 30 years under diﬀerent names and I had wri\\x00en\\nabout one in particular in the books. ‘Not again’ was my reaction\\nwhen QAnon came to the fore. The same script is pulled out every\\nfew years and a new name added to the le\\x00erhead. The story always\\ntakes the same form: ‘Insiders’ or ‘the good guys’ in the government-\\nintelligence-military ‘Deep State’ apparatus were going to instigate\\nmass arrests of the ‘bad guys’ which would include the Rockefellers,\\nRothschilds, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, George Soros, etc., etc.\\nDates are given for when the ‘good guys’ are going to move in, but\\nthe dates pass without incident and new dates are given which pass\\nwithout incident. The central message to Pushbackers in each case is\\nthat they don’t have to do anything because there is ‘a plan’ and it is\\nall going to be sorted by the ‘good guys’ on the inside. ‘Trust the\\nplan’ was a QAnon mantra when the only plan was to misdirect\\nPushbackers into pu\\x00ing their trust in a Psyop they believed to be\\nreal. Beware, beware, those who tell you what you want to hear and\\nalways check it out. Right up to Biden’s inauguration QAnon was\\nstill claiming that ‘the Storm’ was coming and Trump would stay on\\nas president when Biden and his cronies were arrested and jailed. It\\nwas never going to happen and of course it didn’t, but what did\\nhappen as a result provided that punchline to the Sabbatian\\nTrump/QAnon Psyop.\\nOn January 6th, 2021, a very big crowd of Trump supporters\\ngathered in the National Mall in Washington DC down from the\\nCapitol Building to protest at what they believed to be widespread\\ncorruption and vote fraud that stopped Trump being re-elected for a\\nsecond term as president in November, 2020. I say as someone that\\ndoes not support Trump or Biden that the evidence is clear that\\nmajor vote-ﬁxing went on to favour Biden, a man with cognitive\\nproblems so advanced he can o\\x00en hardly string a sentence together\\nwithout reading the words wri\\x00en for him on the Teleprompter.\\nGlaring ballot discrepancies included serious questions about\\nelectronic voting machines that make vote rigging a comparative\\ncinch and hundreds of thousands of paper votes that suddenly\\nappeared during already advanced vote counts and virtually all of them for Biden. Early Trump leads in crucial swing states suddenly\\nbegan to close and disappear. The pandemic hoax was used as the\\nexcuse to issue almost limitless numbers of mail-in ballots with no\\nchecks to establish that the recipients were still alive or lived at that\\naddress. They were sent to streams of people who had not even\\nasked for them. Private organisations were employed to gather these\\nballots and who knows what they did with them before they turned\\nup at the counts. The American election system has been\\nmanipulated over decades to become a sick joke with more holes\\nthan a Swiss cheese for the express purpose of dictating the results.\\nThen there was the criminal manipulation of information by\\nSabbatian tech giants like Facebook, Twi\\x00er and Google-owned\\nYouTube which deleted pro-Trump, anti-Biden accounts and posts\\nwhile everything in support of Biden was le\\x00 alone. Sabbatians\\nwanted Biden to win because a\\x00er the dividing of America it was\\ntime for full-on Woke and every aspect of the Cult agenda to be\\nunleashed.\\nHunter gatherer\\nExtreme Silicon Valley bias included blocking information by the\\nNew York Post exposing a Biden scandal that should have ended his\\nbid for president in the ﬁnal weeks of the campaign. Hunter Biden,\\nhis monumentally corrupt son, is reported to have sent a laptop to\\nbe repaired at a local store and failed to return for it. Time passed\\nuntil the laptop became the property of the store for non-payment of\\nthe bill. When the owner saw what was on the hard drive he gave a\\ncopy to the FBI who did nothing even though it conﬁrmed\\nwidespread corruption in which the Joe Biden family were using his\\npolitical position, especially when he was vice president to Obama,\\nto make multiple millions in countries around the world and most\\nnotably Ukraine and China. Hunter Biden’s one-time business\\npartner Tony Bobulinski went public when the story broke in the\\nNew York Post to conﬁrm the corruption he saw and that Joe Biden\\nnot only knew what was going on he also proﬁted from the spoils.\\nMillions were handed over by a Chinese company with close connections – like all major businesses in China – to the Chinese\\ncommunist party of President Xi Jinping. Joe Biden even boasted at a\\nmeeting of the Cult’s World Economic Forum that as vice president\\nhe had ordered the government of Ukraine to ﬁre a prosecutor. What\\nhe didn’t mention was that the same man just happened to be\\ninvestigating an energy company which was part of Hunter Biden’s\\ncorrupt portfolio. The company was paying him big bucks for no\\nother reason than the inﬂuence his father had. Overnight Biden’s\\npresidential campaign should have been over given that he had lied\\npublicly about not knowing what his son was doing. Instead almost\\nthe entire Sabbatian-owned mainstream media and Sabbatian-\\nowned Silicon Valley suppressed circulation of the story. This alone\\nwent a mighty way to rigging the election of 2020. Cult assets like\\nMark Zuckerberg at Facebook also spent hundreds of millions to be\\nused in support of Biden and vote ‘administration’.\\nThe Cult had used Trump as the focus to divide America and was\\nnow desperate to bring in moronic, pliable, corrupt Biden to\\ncomplete the double-whammy. No way were they going to let li\\x00le\\nthings like the will of the people thwart their plan. Silicon Valley\\nwidely censored claims that the election was rigged because it was\\nrigged. For the same reason anyone claiming it was rigged was\\ndenounced as a ‘white supremacist’ including the pathetically few\\nRepublican politicians willing to say so. Right across the media\\nwhere the claim was mentioned it was described as a ‘false claim’\\neven though these excuses for ‘journalists’ would have done no\\nresearch into the subject whatsoever. Trump won seven million more\\nvotes than any si\\x00ing president had ever achieved while somehow a\\ncognitively-challenged soon to be 78-year-old who was hidden away\\nfrom the public for most of the campaign managed to win more\\nvotes than any presidential candidate in history. It makes no sense.\\nYou only had to see election rallies for both candidates to witness the\\nenthusiasm for Trump and the apathy for Biden. Tens of thousands\\nwould a\\x00end Trump events while Biden was speaking in empty car\\nparks with o\\x00en only television crews a\\x00ending and framing their\\nshots to hide the fact that no one was there. It was pathetic to see footage come to light of Biden standing at a podium making\\nspeeches only to TV crews and party ﬁxers while reading the words\\nwri\\x00en for him on massive Teleprompter screens. So, yes, those\\nprotestors on January 6th had a point about election rigging, but\\nsome were about to walk into a trap laid for them in Washington by\\nthe Cult Deep State and its QAnon Psyop. This was the Capitol Hill\\nriot ludicrously dubbed an ‘insurrection’.\\nThe spider and the fly\\nRenegade Minds know there are not two ‘sides’ in politics, only one\\nside, the Cult, working through all ‘sides’. It’s a stage show, a puppet\\nshow, to direct the perceptions of the population into focusing on\\ndiversions like parties and candidates while missing the puppeteers\\nwith their hands holding all the strings. The Capitol Hill\\n‘insurrection’ brings us back to the Li\\x00le Big Horn. Having created\\ntwo distinct opposing groupings – Woke and Pushbackers – the trap\\nwas about to be sprung. Pushbackers were to be encircled and\\nisolated by associating them all in the public mind with Trump and\\nthen labelling Trump as some sort of Confederate leader. I knew\\nimmediately that the Capitol riot was a set-up because of two things.\\nOne was how easy the rioters got into the building with virtually no\\ncredible resistance and secondly I could see – as with the ‘Covid’\\nhoax in the West at the start of 2020 – how the Cult could exploit the\\nsituation to move its agenda forward with great speed. My\\nexperience of Cult techniques and activities over more than 30 years\\nhas showed me that while they do exploit situations they haven’t\\nthemselves created this never happens with events of fundamental\\nagenda signiﬁcance. Every time major events giving cultists the\\nexcuse to rapidly advance their plan you ﬁnd they are manipulated\\ninto being for the speciﬁc reason of providing that excuse – Problem-\\nReaction-Solution. Only a tiny minority of the huge crowd of\\nWashington protestors sought to gain entry to the Capitol by\\nsmashing windows and breaching doors. That didn’t ma\\x00er. The\\nwhole crowd and all Pushbackers, even if they did not support\\nTrump, were going to be lumped together as dangerous insurrectionists and conspiracy theorists. The la\\x00er term came into\\nwidespread use through a CIA memo in the 1960s aimed at\\ndiscrediting those questioning the nonsensical oﬃcial story of the\\nKennedy assassination and it subsequently became widely\\nemployed by the media. It’s still being used by inept ‘journalists’\\nwith no idea of its origin to discredit anyone questioning anything\\nthat authority claims to be true. When you are perpetrating a\\nconspiracy you need to discredit the very word itself even though\\nthe dictionary deﬁnition of conspiracy is merely ‘the activity of\\nsecretly planning with other people to do something bad or illegal‘\\nand ‘a general agreement to keep silent about a subject for the\\npurpose of keeping it secret’. On that basis there are conspiracies\\nalmost wherever you look. For obvious reasons the Cult and its\\nlapdog media have to claim there are no conspiracies even though\\nthe word appears in state laws as with conspiracy to defraud, to\\nmurder, and to corrupt public morals.\\nAgent provocateurs are widely used by the Cult Deep State to\\nmanipulate genuine people into acting in ways that suit the desired\\noutcome. By genuine in this case I mean protestors genuinely\\nsupporting Trump and claims that the election was stolen. In among\\nthem, however, were agents of the state wearing the garb of Trump\\nsupporters and QAnon to pump-prime the Capital riot which some\\ngenuine Trump supporters naively fell for. I described the situation\\nas ‘Come into my parlour said the spider to the ﬂy’. Leaﬂets\\nappeared through the Woke paramilitary arm Antifa, the anti-fascist\\nfascists, calling on supporters to turn up in Washington looking like\\nTrump supporters even though they hated him. Some of those\\narrested for breaching the Capitol Building were sourced to Antifa\\nand its stable mate Black Lives Ma\\x00er. Both organisations are funded\\nby Cult billionaires and corporations. One man charged for the riot\\nwas according to his lawyer a former FBI agent who had held top\\nsecret security clearance for 40 years. A\\x00orney Thomas Plofchan said\\nof his client, 66-year-old Thomas Edward Caldwell:\\nHe has held a Top Secret Security Clearance since 1979 and has undergone multiple Special\\nBackground Investigations in support of his clearances. After retiring from the Navy, he worked as a section chief for the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 2009-2010 as a GS-12\\n[mid-level employee].\\nHe also formed and operated a consulting firm performing work, often classified, for U.S\\ngovernment customers including the US. Drug Enforcement Agency, Department of Housing\\nand Urban Development, the US Coast Guard, and the US Army Personnel Command.\\nA judge later released Caldwell pending trial in the absence of\\nevidence about a conspiracy or that he tried to force his way into the\\nbuilding. The New York Post reported a ‘law enforcement source‘ as\\nsaying that ‘at least two known Antifa members were spo\\x00ed’ on\\ncamera among Trump supporters during the riot while one of the\\nrioters arrested was John Earle Sullivan, a seriously extreme Black\\nLives Ma\\x00er Trump-hater from Utah who was previously arrested\\nand charged in July, 2020, over a BLM-Antifa riot in which drivers\\nwere threatened and one was shot. Sullivan is the founder of Utah-\\nbased Insurgence USA which is an aﬃliate of the Cult-created-and-\\nfunded Black Lives Ma\\x00er movement. Footage appeared and was\\nthen deleted by Twi\\x00er of Trump supporters calling out Antifa\\ninﬁltrators and a group was ﬁlmed changing into pro-Trump\\nclothing before the riot. Security at the building was pathetic – as\\nplanned. Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty, a man with long experience\\nin covert operations working with the US security apparatus, once\\ndescribed the tell-tale sign to identify who is involved in an\\nassassination. He said:\\nNo one has to direct an assassination – it happens. The active role is played secretly by\\npermitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who has the power to call off or\\nreduce the usual security precautions?\\nThis principle applies to many other situations and certainly to the\\nCapitol riot of January 6th, 2021.\\nThe sting\\nWith such a big and potentially angry crowd known to be gathering\\nnear the Capitol the security apparatus would have had a major\\npolice detail to defend the building with National Guard troops on standby given the strength of feeling among people arriving from all\\nover America encouraged by the QAnon Psyop and statements by\\nDonald Trump. Instead Capitol Police ‘security’ was ﬂimsy, weak,\\nand easily breached. The same number of oﬃcers was deployed as\\non a regular day and that is a blatant red ﬂag. They were not staﬀed\\nor equipped for a possible riot that had been an obvious possibility\\nin the circumstances. No protective and eﬀective fencing worth the\\nname was put in place and there were no contingency plans. The\\nwhole thing was basically a case of standing aside and waving\\npeople in. Once inside police mostly backed oﬀ apart from one\\nCapitol police oﬃcer who ridiculously shot dead unarmed Air Force\\nveteran protestor Ashli Babbi\\x00 without a warning as she climbed\\nthrough a broken window. The ‘investigation’ refused to name or\\ncharge the oﬃcer a\\x00er what must surely be considered a murder in\\nthe circumstances. They just li\\x00ed a carpet and swept. The story was\\nendlessly repeated about ﬁve people dying in the ‘armed\\ninsurrection’ when there was no report of rioters using weapons.\\nApart from Babbi\\x00 the other four died from a heart a\\x00ack, strokes\\nand apparently a drug overdose. Capitol police oﬃcer Brian Sicknick\\nwas reported to have died a\\x00er being bludgeoned with a ﬁre\\nextinguisher when he was alive a\\x00er the riot was over and died later\\nof what the Washington Medical Examiner’s Oﬃce said was a stroke.\\nSicknick had no external injuries. The lies were delivered like rapid\\nﬁre. There was a narrative to build with incessant repetition of the lie\\nuntil the lie became the accepted ‘everybody knows that’ truth. The\\n‘Big Lie’ technique of Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels is\\nconstantly used by the Cult which was behind the Nazis and is\\ntoday behind the ‘Covid’ and ‘climate change’ hoaxes. Goebbels\\nsaid:\\nIf you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.\\nThe lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the\\npolitical, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important\\nfor the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the\\nlie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State. Most protestors had a free run of the Capitol Building. This\\nallowed pictures to be taken of rioters in iconic parts of the building\\nincluding the Senate chamber which could be used as propaganda\\nimages against all Pushbackers. One Congresswoman described the\\nscene as ‘the worst kind of non-security anybody could ever\\nimagine’. Well, the ﬁrst part was true, but someone obviously did\\nimagine it and made sure it happened. Some photographs most\\nwidely circulated featured people wearing QAnon symbols and now\\nthe Psyop would be used to dub all QAnon followers with the\\nubiquitous ﬁt-all label of ‘white supremacist’ and ‘insurrectionists’.\\nWhen a Muslim extremist called Noah Green drove his car at two\\npolice oﬃcers at the Capitol Building killing one in April, 2021, there\\nwas no such political and media hysteria. They were just\\ndisappointed he wasn’t white.\\nThe witch-hunt\\nGovernment prosecutor Michael Sherwin, an aggressive, dark-eyed,\\nprofessional Ro\\x00weiler led the ‘investigation’ and to call it over the\\ntop would be to understate reality a thousand fold. Hundreds were\\ntracked down and arrested for the crime of having the wrong\\npolitical views and people were jailed who had done nothing more\\nthan walk in the building, commi\\x00ed no violence or damage to\\nproperty, took a few pictures and le\\x00. They were labelled a ‘threat to\\nthe Republic’ while Biden sat in the White House signing executive\\norders wri\\x00en for him that were dismantling ‘the Republic’. Even\\nwhen judges ruled that a mother and son should not be in jail the\\ngovernment kept them there. Some of those arrested have been\\nbadly beaten by prison guards in Washington and lawyers for one\\nman said he suﬀered a fractured skull and was made blind in one\\neye. Meanwhile a woman is shot dead for no reason by a Capitol\\nPolice oﬃcer and we are not allowed to know who he is never mind\\nwhat has happened to him although that will be nothing. The Cult’s\\nQAnon/Trump sting to identify and isolate Pushbackers and then\\ntarget them on the road to crushing and deleting them was a\\nresounding success. You would have thought the Russians had invaded the building at gunpoint and lined up senators for a ﬁring\\nsquad to see the political and media reaction. Congresswoman\\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a child in a woman’s body, a terrible-\\ntwos, me, me, me, Woker narcissist of such proportions that words\\nhave no meaning. She said she thought she was going to die when\\n‘insurrectionists’ banged on her oﬃce door. It turned out she wasn’t\\neven in the Capitol Building when the riot was happening and the\\n‘banging’ was a Capitol Police oﬃcer. She referred to herself as a\\n‘survivor’ which is an insult to all those true survivors of violent and\\nsexual abuse while she lives her pampered and privileged life\\ntalking drivel for a living. Her Woke colleague and fellow mega-\\nnarcissist Rashida Tlaib broke down describing the devastating\\neﬀect on her, too, of not being in the building when the rioters were\\nthere. Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib are members of a fully-Woke group\\nof Congresswomen known as ‘The Squad’ along with Ilhan Omar\\nand Ayanna Pressley. The Squad from what I can see can be\\nidentiﬁed by its vehement anti-white racism, anti-white men agenda,\\nand, as always in these cases, the absence of brain cells on active\\nduty.\\nThe usual suspects were on the riot case immediately in the form\\nof Democrat ultra-Zionist senators and operatives Chuck Schumer\\nand Adam Schiﬀ demanding that Trump be impeached for ‘his part\\nin the insurrection’. The same pair of prats had led the failed\\nimpeachment of Trump over the invented ‘Russia collusion’\\nnonsense which claimed Russia had helped Trump win the 2016\\nelection. I didn’t realise that Tel Aviv had been relocated just outside\\nMoscow. I must ﬁnd an up-to-date map. The Russia hoax was a\\nSabbatian operation to keep Trump occupied and impotent and to\\nstop any rapport with Russia which the Cult wants to retain as a\\nperceptual enemy to be pulled out at will. Puppet Biden began\\na\\x00acking Russia when he came to oﬃce as the Cult seeks more\\nupheaval, division and war across the world. A two-year stage show\\n‘Russia collusion inquiry’ headed by the not-very-bright former 9/11\\nFBI chief Robert Mueller, with support from 19 lawyers, 40 FBI\\nagents plus intelligence analysts, forensic accountants and other staﬀ, devoured tens of millions of dollars and found no evidence of\\nRussia collusion which a ten-year-old could have told them on day\\none. Now the same moronic Schumer and Schiﬀ wanted a second\\nimpeachment of Trump over the Capitol ‘insurrection’ (riot) which\\nthe arrested development of Schumer called another ‘Pearl Harbor’\\nwhile others compared it with 9/11 in which 3,000 died and, in the\\ncase of CNN, with the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s in which an\\nestimated 500,000 to 600,000 were murdered, between 250, 000 and\\n500,000 women were raped, and populations of whole towns were\\nhacked to death with machetes. To make those comparisons purely\\nfor Cult political reasons is beyond insulting to those that suﬀered\\nand lost their lives and conﬁrms yet again the callous inhumanity\\nthat we are dealing with. Schumer is a monumental idiot and so is\\nSchiﬀ, but they serve the Cult agenda and do whatever they’re told\\nso they get looked a\\x00er. Talking of idiots – another inane man who\\nspanned the Russia and Capitol impeachment a\\x00empts was Senator\\nEric Swalwell who had the nerve to accuse Trump of collusion with\\nthe Russians while sleeping with a Chinese spy called Christine Fang\\nor ‘Fang Fang’ which is straight out of a Bond ﬁlm no doubt starring\\nKlaus Schwab as the bloke living on a secret island and controlling\\nlaser weapons positioned in space and pointing at world capitals.\\nFang Fang plays the part of Bond’s inﬁltrator girlfriend which I’m\\nsure she would enjoy rather more than sharing a bed with the\\nbrainless Swalwell, lying back and thinking of China. The FBI\\neventually warned Swalwell about Fang Fang which gave her time\\nto escape back to the Chinese dictatorship. How very thoughtful of\\nthem. The second Trump impeachment also failed and hardly\\nsurprising when an impeachment is supposed to remove a si\\x00ing\\npresident and by the time it happened Trump was no longer\\npresident. These people are running your country America, well,\\noﬃcially anyway. Terrifying isn’t it?\\nOutcomes tell the story - always\\nThe outcome of all this – and it’s the outcome on which Renegade\\nMinds focus, not the words – was that a vicious, hysterical and obviously pre-planned assault was launched on Pushbackers to\\ncensor, silence and discredit them and even targeted their right to\\nearn a living. They have since been condemned as ‘domestic\\nterrorists’ that need to be treated like Al-Qaeda and Islamic State.\\n‘Domestic terrorists’ is a label the Cult has been trying to make stick\\nsince the period of the Oklahoma bombing in 1995 which was\\nblamed on ‘far-right domestic terrorists’. If you read The Trigger you\\nwill see that the bombing was clearly a Problem-Reaction-Solution\\ncarried out by the Deep State during a Bill Clinton administration so\\ncorrupt that no dictionary deﬁnition of the term would even nearly\\nsuﬃce. Nearly 30, 000 troops were deployed from all over America\\nto the empty streets of Washington for Biden’s inauguration. Ten\\nthousand of them stayed on with the pretext of protecting the capital\\nfrom insurrectionists when it was more psychological programming\\nto normalise the use of the military in domestic law enforcement in\\nsupport of the Cult plan for a police-military state. Biden’s fascist\\nadministration began a purge of ‘wrong-thinkers’ in the military\\nwhich means anyone that is not on board with Woke. The Capitol\\nBuilding was surrounded by a fence with razor wire and the Land of\\nthe Free was further symbolically and literally dismantled. The circle\\nwas completed with the installation of Biden and the exploitation of\\nthe QAnon Psyop.\\nAmerica had never been so divided since the civil war of the 19th\\ncentury, Pushbackers were isolated and dubbed terrorists and now,\\nas was always going to happen, the Cult immediately set about\\ndeleting what li\\x00le was le\\x00 of freedom and transforming American\\nsociety through a swish of the hand of the most controlled\\n‘president’ in American history leading (oﬃcially at least) the most\\nextreme regime since the country was declared an independent state\\non July 4th, 1776. Biden issued undebated, dictatorial executive\\norders almost by the hour in his opening days in oﬃce across the\\nwhole spectrum of the Cult wish-list including diluting controls on\\nthe border with Mexico allowing thousands of migrants to illegally\\nenter the United States to transform the demographics of America\\nand import an election-changing number of perceived Democrat voters. Then there were Biden deportation amnesties for the already\\nillegally resident (estimated to be as high as 20 or even 30 million). A\\nbill before Congress awarded American citizenship to anyone who\\ncould prove they had worked in agriculture for just 180 days in the\\nprevious two years as ‘Big Ag’ secured its slave labour long-term.\\nThere were the plans to add new states to the union such as Puerto\\nRico and making Washington DC a state. They are all parts of a plan\\nto ensure that the Cult-owned Woke Democrats would be\\npermanently in power.\\nBorder – what border?\\nI have exposed in detail in other books how mass immigration into\\nthe United States and Europe is the work of Cult networks fuelled by\\nthe tens of billions spent to this and other ends by George Soros and\\nhis global Open Society (open borders) Foundations. The impact can\\nbe seen in America alone where the population has increased by 100\\nmillion in li\\x00le more than 30 years mostly through immigration. I\\nwrote in The Answer that the plan was to have so many people\\ncrossing the southern border that the numbers become unstoppable\\nand we are now there under Cult-owned Biden. El Salvador in\\nCentral America puts the scale of what is happening into context. A\\nthird of the population now lives in the United States, much of it\\nillegally, and many more are on the way. The methodology is to\\ncrush Central and South American countries economically and\\nspread violence through machete-wielding psychopathic gangs like\\nMS-13 based in El Salvador and now operating in many American\\ncities. Biden-imposed lax security at the southern border means that\\nit is all but open. He said before his ‘election’ that he wanted to see a\\nsurge towards the border if he became president and that was the\\ngreen light for people to do just that a\\x00er election day to create the\\nhuman disaster that followed for both America and the migrants.\\nWhen that surge came the imbecilic Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said it\\nwasn’t a ‘surge’ because they are ‘children, not insurgents’ and the\\nterm ‘surge’ (used by Biden) was a claim of ‘white supremacists’. This disingenuous lady may one day enter the realm of the most\\nbasic intelligence, but it won’t be any time soon.\\nSabbatians and the Cult are in the process of destroying America\\nby importing violent people and gangs in among the genuine to\\nterrorise American cities and by overwhelming services that cannot\\ncope with the sheer volume of new arrivals. Something similar is\\nhappening in Europe as Western society in general is targeted for\\ndemographic and cultural transformation and upheaval. The plan\\ndemands violence and crime to create an environment of\\nintimidation, fear and division and Soros has been funding the\\nelection of district a\\x00orneys across America who then stop\\nprosecuting many crimes, reduce sentences for violent crimes and\\nfree as many violent criminals as they can. Sabbatians are creating\\nthe chaos from which order – their order – can respond in a classic\\nProblem-Reaction-Solution. A Freemasonic moto says ‘Ordo Ab\\nChao’ (Order out of Chaos) and this is why the Cult is constantly\\ncreating chaos to impose a new ‘order’. Here you have the reason\\nthe Cult is constantly creating chaos. The ‘Covid’ hoax can be seen\\nwith those entering the United States by plane being forced to take a\\n‘Covid’ test while migrants ﬂooding through southern border\\nprocessing facilities do not. Nothing is put in the way of mass\\nmigration and if that means ignoring the government’s own ‘Covid’\\nrules then so be it. They know it’s all bullshit anyway. Any pushback\\non this is denounced as ‘racist’ by Wokers and Sabbatian fronts like\\nthe ultra-Zionist Anti-Defamation League headed by the appalling\\nJonathan Greenbla\\x00 which at the same time argues that Israel should\\nnot give citizenship and voting rights to more Palestinian Arabs or\\nthe ‘Jewish population’ (in truth the Sabbatian network) will lose\\ncontrol of the country.\\nSociety-changing numbers\\nBiden’s masters have declared that countries like El Salvador are so\\ndangerous that their people must be allowed into the United States\\nfor humanitarian reasons when there are fewer murders in large\\nparts of many Central American countries than in US cities like Baltimore. That is not to say Central America cannot be a dangerous\\nplace and Cult-controlled American governments have been making\\nit so since way back, along with the dismantling of economies, in a\\nlong-term plan to drive people north into the United States. Parts of\\nCentral America are very dangerous, but in other areas the story is\\nbeing greatly exaggerated to justify relaxing immigration criteria.\\nMigrants are being oﬀered free healthcare and education in the\\nUnited States as another incentive to head for the border and there is\\nno requirement to be ﬁnancially independent before you can enter to\\nprevent the resources of America being drained. You can’t blame\\nmigrants for seeking what they believe will be a be\\x00er life, but they\\nare being played by the Cult for dark and nefarious ends. The\\nnumbers since Biden took oﬃce are huge. In February, 2021, more\\nthan 100,000 people were known to have tried to enter the US\\nillegally through the southern border (it was 34,000 in the same\\nmonth in 2020) and in March it was 170,000 – a 418 percent increase\\non March, 2020. These numbers are only known people, not the ones\\nwho get in unseen. The true ﬁgure for migrants illegally crossing the\\nborder in a single month was estimated by one congressman at\\n250,000 and that number will only rise under Biden’s current policy.\\nGangs of murdering drug-running thugs that control the Mexican\\nside of the border demand money – thousands of dollars – to let\\nmigrants cross the Rio Grande into America. At the same time gun\\nba\\x00les are breaking out on the border several times a week between\\nrival Mexican drug gangs (which now operate globally) who are\\nequipped with sophisticated military-grade weapons, grenades and\\narmoured vehicles. While the Capitol Building was being ‘protected’\\nfrom a non-existent ‘threat’ by thousands of troops, and others were\\nstill deployed at the time in the Cult Neocon war in Afghanistan, the\\nsouthern border of America was le\\x00 to its fate. This is not\\nincompetence, it is cold calculation.\\nBy March, 2021, there were 17,000 unaccompanied children held at\\nborder facilities and many of them are ensnared by people traﬃckers\\nfor paedophile rings and raped on their journey north to America.\\nThis is not conjecture – this is fact. Many of those designated children are in reality teenage boys or older. Meanwhile Wokers\\nposture their self-purity for encouraging poor and tragic people to\\ncome to America and face this nightmare both on the journey and at\\nthe border with the disgusting ﬁgure of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\ngiving disingenuous speeches about caring for migrants. The\\nwoman’s evil. Wokers condemned Trump for having children in\\ncages at the border (so did Obama, Shhhh), but now they are sleeping\\non the ﬂoor without access to a shower with one border facility 729\\npercent over capacity. The Biden insanity even proposed ﬂying\\nmigrants from the southern border to the northern border with\\nCanada for ‘processing’. The whole shambles is being overseen by\\nultra-Zionist Secretary of Homeland Security, the moronic liar\\nAlejandro Mayorkas, who banned news cameras at border facilities\\nto stop Americans seeing what was happening. Mayorkas said there\\nwas not a ban on news crews; it was just that they were not allowed\\nto ﬁlm. Alongside him at Homeland Security is another ultra-Zionist\\nCass Sunstein appointed by Biden to oversee new immigration laws.\\nSunstein despises conspiracy researchers to the point where he\\nsuggests they should be banned or taxed for having such views. The\\nman is not bonkers or anything. He’s perfectly well-adjusted, but\\nadjusted to what is the question. Criticise what is happening and\\nyou are a ‘white supremacist’ when earlier non-white immigrants\\nalso oppose the numbers which eﬀect their lives and opportunities.\\nBlack people in poor areas are particularly damaged by uncontrolled\\nimmigration and the increased competition for work opportunities\\nwith those who will work for less. They are also losing voting power\\nas Hispanics become more dominant in former black areas. It’s a\\ndownward spiral for them while the billionaires behind the policy\\ndrone on about how much they care about black people and\\n‘racism’. None of this is about compassion for migrants or black\\npeople – that’s just wind and air. Migrants are instead being\\nmercilessly exploited to transform America while the countries they\\nleave are losing their future and the same is true in Europe. Mass\\nimmigration may now be the work of Woke Democrats, but it can be\\ntraced back to the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (it wasn’t) signed into law by Republican hero President Ronald\\nReagan which gave amnesty to millions living in the United States\\nillegally and other incentives for people to head for the southern\\nborder. Here we have the one-party state at work again.\\nSave me syndrome\\nAlmost every aspect of what I have been exposing as the Cult\\nagenda was on display in even the ﬁrst days of ‘Biden’ with silencing\\nof Pushbackers at the forefront of everything. A Renegade Mind will\\nview the Trump years and QAnon in a very diﬀerent light to their\\nsupporters and advocates as the dots are connected. The\\nQAnon/Trump Psyop has given the Cult all it was looking for. We\\nmay not know how much, or li\\x00le, that Trump realised he was being\\nused, but that’s a side issue. This pincer movement produced the\\ndesired outcome of dividing America and having Pushbackers\\nisolated. To turn this around we have to look at new routes to\\nempowerment which do not include handing our power to other\\npeople and groups through what I will call the ‘Save Me Syndrome’\\n– ‘I want someone else to do it so that I don’t have to’. We have seen\\nthis at work throughout human history and the QAnon/Trump\\nPsyop is only the latest incarnation alongside all the others. Religion\\nis an obvious expression of this when people look to a ‘god’ or priest\\nto save them or tell them how to be saved and then there are ‘save\\nme’ politicians like Trump. Politics is a diversion and not a ‘saviour’.\\nIt is a means to block positive change, not make it possible.\\nSave Me Syndrome always comes with the same repeating theme\\nof handing your power to whom or what you believe will save you\\nwhile your real ‘saviour’ stares back from the mirror every morning.\\nRenegade Minds are constantly vigilant in this regard and always\\nasking the question ‘What can I do?’ rather than ‘What can someone\\nelse do for me?’ Gandhi was right when he said: ‘You must be the\\nchange you want to see in the world.’ We are indeed the people we\\nhave been waiting for. We are presented with a constant ra\\x00 of\\nreasons to concede that power to others and forget where the real\\npower is. Humanity has the numbers and the Cult does not. It has to use diversion and division to target the unstoppable power that\\ncomes from unity. Religions, governments, politicians, corporations,\\nmedia, QAnon, are all diﬀerent manifestations of this power-\\ndiversion and dilution. Refusing to give your power to governments\\nand instead handing it to Trump and QAnon is not to take a new\\ndirection, but merely to recycle the old one with new names on the\\nposters. I will explore this phenomenon as we proceed and how to\\nbreak the cycles and recycles that got us here through the mists of\\nrepeating perception and so repeating history.\\nFor now we shall turn to the most potent example in the entire\\nhuman story of the consequences that follow when you give your\\npower away. I am talking, of course, of the ‘Covid’ hoax. W\\nCHAPTER FOUR\\n‘Covid’: Calculated catastrophe\\nFacts are threatening to those invested in fraud\\nDaShanne Stokes\\ne can easily unravel the real reason for the ‘Covid pandemic’\\nhoax by employing the Renegade Mind methodology that I\\nhave outlined this far. We’ll start by comparing the long-planned\\nCult outcome with the ‘Covid pandemic’ outcome. Know the\\noutcome and you’ll see the journey.\\nI have highlighted the plan for the Hunger Games Society which\\nhas been in my books for so many years with the very few\\ncontrolling the very many through ongoing dependency. To create\\nthis dependency it is essential to destroy independent livelihoods,\\nbusinesses and employment to make the population reliant on the\\nstate (the Cult) for even the basics of life through a guaranteed\\npi\\x00ance income. While independence of income remained these Cult\\nambitions would be thwarted. With this knowledge it was easy to\\nsee where the ‘pandemic’ hoax was going once talk of ‘lockdowns’\\nbegan and the closing of all but perceived ‘essential’ businesses to\\n‘save’ us from an alleged ‘deadly virus’. Cult corporations like\\nAmazon and Walmart were naturally considered ‘essential’ while\\nmom and pop shops and stores had their doors closed by fascist\\ndecree. As a result with every new lockdown and new regulation\\nmore small and medium, even large businesses not owned by the\\nCult, went to the wall while Cult giants and their frontmen and\\nwomen grew ﬁnancially fa\\x00er by the second. Mom and pop were denied an income and the right to earn a living and the wealth of\\npeople like Jeﬀ Bezos (Amazon), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) and\\nSergei Brin and Larry Page (Google/Alphabet) have reached record\\nlevels. The Cult was increasing its own power through further\\ndramatic concentrations of wealth while the competition was being\\ndestroyed and brought into a state of dependency. Lockdowns have\\nbeen instigated to secure that very end and were never anything to\\ndo with health. My brother Paul spent 45 years building up a bus\\nrepair business, but lockdowns meant buses were running at a\\nfraction of normal levels for months on end. Similar stories can told\\nin their hundreds of millions worldwide. Eﬀorts of a lifetime coldly\\ndestroyed by Cult multi-billionaires and their lackeys in government\\nand law enforcement who continued to earn their living from the\\ntaxation of the people while denying the right of the same people to\\nearn theirs. How diﬀerent it would have been if those making and\\nenforcing these decisions had to face the same ﬁnancial hardships of\\nthose they aﬀected, but they never do.\\nGates of Hell\\nBehind it all in the full knowledge of what he is doing and why is\\nthe psychopathic ﬁgure of Cult operative Bill Gates. His puppet\\nTedros at the World Health Organization declared ‘Covid’ a\\npandemic in March, 2020. The WHO had changed the deﬁnition of a\\n‘pandemic’ in 2009 just a month before declaring the ‘swine ﬂu\\npandemic’ which would not have been so under the previous\\ndeﬁnition. The same applies to ‘Covid’. The deﬁnition had\\nincluded… ‘an infection by an infectious agent, occurring\\nsimultaneously in diﬀerent countries, with a signiﬁcant mortality\\nrate relative to the proportion of the population infected’. The new\\ndeﬁnition removed the need for ‘signiﬁcant mortality’. The\\n‘pandemic’ has been fraudulent even down to the deﬁnition, but\\nGates demanded economy-destroying lockdowns, school closures,\\nsocial distancing, mandatory masks, a ‘vaccination’ for every man,\\nwoman and child on the planet and severe consequences and\\nrestrictions for those that refused. Who gave him this power? The Cult did which he serves like a li\\x00le boy in short trousers doing\\nwhat his daddy tells him. He and his psychopathic missus even\\nsmiled when they said that much worse was to come (what they\\nknew was planned to come). Gates responded in the ma\\x00er-of-fact\\nway of all psychopaths to a question about the eﬀect on the world\\neconomy of what he was doing:\\nWell, it won’t go to zero but it will shrink. Global GDP is probably going to take the biggest\\nhit ever [Gates was smiling as he said this] … in my lifetime this will be the greatest economic\\nhit. But you don’t have a choice. People act as if you have a choice. People don’t feel like\\ngoing to the stadium when they might get infected … People are deeply affected by seeing\\nthese stats, by knowing they could be part of the transmission chain, old people, their parents\\nand grandparents, could be affected by this, and so you don’t get to say ignore what is going\\non here.\\nThere will be the ability to open up, particularly in rich countries, if things are done well over\\nthe next few months, but for the world at large normalcy only returns when we have largely\\nvaccinated the entire population.\\nThe man has no compassion or empathy. How could he when he’s\\na psychopath like all Cult players? My own view is that even beyond\\nthat he is very seriously mentally ill. Look in his eyes and you can\\nsee this along with his crazy ﬂailing arms. You don’t do what he has\\ndone to the world population since the start of 2020 unless you are\\nmentally ill and at the most extreme end of psychopathic. You\\nespecially don’t do it when to you know, as we shall see, that cases\\nand deaths from ‘Covid’ are fakery and a product of monumental\\nﬁgure massaging. ‘These stats’ that Gates referred to are based on a\\n‘test’ that’s not testing for the ‘virus’ as he has known all along. He\\nmade his fortune with big Cult support as an infamously ruthless\\nso\\x00ware salesman and now buys global control of ‘health’ (death)\\npolicy without the population he aﬀects having any say. It’s a\\nbreathtaking outrage. Gates talked about people being deeply\\naﬀected by fear of ‘Covid’ when that was because of him and his\\nglobal network lying to them minute-by-minute supported by a\\nlying media that he seriously inﬂuences and funds to the tune of\\nhundreds of millions. He’s handed big sums to media operations\\nincluding the BBC, NBC, Al Jazeera, Univision, PBS NewsHour, ProPublica, National Journal, The Guardian, The Financial Times, The\\nAtlantic, Texas Tribune, USA Today publisher Ganne\\x00, Washington\\nMonthly, Le Monde, Center for Investigative Reporting, Pulitzer\\nCenter on Crisis Reporting, National Press Foundation, International\\nCenter for Journalists, Solutions Journalism Network, the Poynter\\nInstitute for Media Studies, and many more. Gates is everywhere in\\nthe ‘Covid’ hoax and the man must go to prison – or a mental facility\\n– for the rest of his life and his money distributed to those he has\\ntaken such enormous psychopathic pleasure in crushing.\\nThe Muscle\\nThe Hunger Games global structure demands a police-military state\\n– a fusion of the two into one force – which viciously imposes the\\nwill of the Cult on the population and protects the Cult from public\\nrebellion. In that regard, too, the ‘Covid’ hoax just keeps on giving.\\nO\\x00en unlawful, ridiculous and contradictory ‘Covid’ rules and\\nregulations have been policed across the world by moronic\\nautomatons and psychopaths made faceless by face-nappy masks\\nand acting like the Nazi SS and fascist blackshirts and brownshirts of\\nHitler and Mussolini. The smallest departure from the rules decreed\\nby the psychos in government and their clueless gofers were jumped\\nupon by the face-nappy fascists. Brutality against public protestors\\nsoon became commonplace even on girls, women and old people as\\nthe brave men with the batons – the Face-Nappies as I call them –\\nbroke up peaceful protests and handed out ﬁnes like confe\\x00i to\\npeople who couldn’t earn a living let alone pay hundreds of pounds\\nfor what was once an accepted human right. Robot Face-Nappies of\\nNo\\x00ingham police in the English East Midlands ﬁned one group\\n£11,000 for a\\x00ending a child’s birthday party. For decades I charted\\nthe transformation of law enforcement as genuine, decent oﬃcers\\nwere replaced with psychopaths and the brain dead who would\\nhappily and brutally do whatever their masters told them. Now they\\nwere let loose on the public and I would emphasise the point that\\nnone of this just happened. The step-by-step change in the dynamic\\nbetween police and public was orchestrated from the shadows by those who knew where this was all going and the same with the\\nperceptual reframing of those in all levels of authority and oﬃcial\\nadministration through ‘training courses’ by organisations such as\\nCommon Purpose which was created in the late 1980s and given a\\nmassive boost in Blair era Britain until it became a global\\nphenomenon. Supposed public ‘servants’ began to view the\\npopulation as the enemy and the same was true of the police. This\\nwas the start of the explosion of behaviour manipulation\\norganisations and networks preparing for the all-war on the human\\npsyche unleashed with the dawn of 2020. I will go into more detail\\nabout this later in the book because it is a core part of what is\\nhappening.\\nPolice desecrated beauty spots to deter people gathering and\\narrested women for walking in the countryside alone ‘too far’ from\\ntheir homes. We had arrogant, clueless sergeants in the Isle of Wight\\npolice where I live posting on Facebook what they insisted the\\npopulation must do or else. A schoolmaster sergeant called Radford\\nlooked young enough for me to ask if his mother knew he was out,\\nbut he was posting what he expected people to do while a Sergeant\\nWilkinson boasted about ﬁning lads for meeting in a McDonald’s car\\npark where they went to get a lockdown takeaway. Wilkinson added\\nthat he had even cancelled their order. What a pair of prats these\\npeople are and yet they have increasingly become the norm among\\nJackboot Johnson’s Yellowshirts once known as the British police.\\nThis was the theme all over the world with police savagery common\\nduring lockdown protests in the United States, the Netherlands, and\\nthe fascist state of Victoria in Australia under its tyrannical and\\nagain moronic premier Daniel Andrews. Amazing how tyrannical\\nand moronic tend to work as a team and the same combination\\ncould be seen across America as arrogant, narcissistic Woke\\ngovernors and mayors such as Gavin Newsom (California), Andrew\\nCuomo (New York), Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan), Lori Lightfoot\\n(Chicago) and Eric Garce\\x00i (Los Angeles) did their Nazi and Stalin\\nimpressions with the full support of the compliant brutality of their\\nenforcers in uniform as they arrested small business owners defying fascist shutdown orders and took them to jail in ankle shackles and\\nhandcuﬀs. This happened to bistro owner Marlena Pavlos-Hackney\\nin Gretchen Whitmer’s fascist state of Michigan when police arrived\\nto enforce an order by a state-owned judge for ‘pu\\x00ing the\\ncommunity at risk’ at a time when other states like Texas were\\ndropping restrictions and migrants were pouring across the\\nsouthern border without any ‘Covid’ questions at all. I’m sure there\\nare many oﬃcers appalled by what they are ordered to do, but not\\nnearly enough of them. If they were truly appalled they would not\\ndo it. As the months passed every opportunity was taken to have the\\nmilitary involved to make their presence on the streets ever more\\nfamiliar and ‘normal’ for the longer-term goal of police-military\\nfusion.\\nAnother crucial element to the Hunger Games enforcement\\nnetwork has been encouraging the public to report neighbours and\\nothers for ‘breaking the lockdown rules’. The group faced with\\n£11,000 in ﬁnes at the child’s birthday party would have been\\ndobbed-in by a neighbour with a brain the size of a pea. The\\ntechnique was most famously employed by the Stasi secret police in\\ncommunist East Germany who had public informants placed\\nthroughout the population. A police chief in the UK says his force\\ndoesn’t need to carry out ‘Covid’ patrols when they are ﬂooded with\\nso many calls from the public reporting other people for visiting the\\nbeach. Dorset police chief James Vaughan said people were so\\nenthusiastic about snitching on their fellow humans they were now\\noperating as an auxiliary arm of the police: ‘We are still ge\\x00ing\\naround 400 reports a week from the public, so we will respond to\\nreports …We won’t need to be doing hotspot patrols because people\\nare very quick to pick the phone up and tell us.’ Vaughan didn’t say\\nthat this is a pillar of all tyrannies of whatever complexion and the\\nmeans to hugely extend the reach of enforcement while spreading\\ndistrust among the people and making them wary of doing anything\\nthat might get them reported. Those narcissistic Isle of Wight\\nsergeants Radford and Wilkinson never fail to add a link to their\\nFacebook posts where the public can inform on their fellow slaves. Neither would be self-aware enough to realise they were imitating\\nthe Stasi which they might well never have heard of. Government\\npsychologists that I will expose later laid out a policy to turn\\ncommunities against each other in the same way.\\nA coincidence? Yep, and I can knit fog\\nI knew from the start of the alleged pandemic that this was a Cult\\noperation. It presented limitless potential to rapidly advance the Cult\\nagenda and exploit manipulated fear to demand that every man,\\nwoman and child on the planet was ‘vaccinated’ in a process never\\nused on humans before which infuses self-replicating synthetic\\nmaterial into human cells. Remember the plan to transform the\\nhuman body from a biological to a synthetic biological state. I’ll deal\\nwith the ‘vaccine’ (that’s not actually a vaccine) when I focus on the\\ngenetic agenda. Enough to say here that mass global ‘vaccination’\\njustiﬁed by this ‘new virus’ set alarms ringing a\\x00er 30 years of\\ntracking these people and their methods. The ‘Covid’ hoax oﬃcially\\nbeginning in China was also a big red ﬂag for reasons I will be\\nexplaining. The agenda potential was so enormous that I could\\ndismiss any idea that the ‘virus’ appeared naturally. Major\\nhappenings with major agenda implications never occur without\\nCult involvement in making them happen. My questions were\\ntwofold in early 2020 as the media began its campaign to induce\\nglobal fear and hysteria: Was this alleged infectious agent released\\non purpose by the Cult or did it even exist at all? I then did what I\\nalways do in these situations. I sat, observed and waited to see\\nwhere the evidence and information would take me. By March and\\nearly April synchronicity was strongly – and ever more so since then\\n– pointing me in the direction of there is no ‘virus’. I went public on\\nthat with derision even from swathes of the alternative media that\\nvoiced a scenario that the Chinese government released the ‘virus’ in\\nleague with Deep State elements in the United States from a top-\\nlevel bio-lab in Wuhan where the ‘virus’ is said to have ﬁrst\\nappeared. I looked at that possibility, but I didn’t buy it for several\\nreasons. Deaths from the ‘virus’ did not in any way match what they would have been with a ‘deadly bioweapon’ and it is much more\\neﬀective if you sell the illusion of an infectious agent rather than\\nhaving a real one unless you can control through injection who has it\\nand who doesn’t. Otherwise you lose control of events. A made-up\\n‘virus’ gives you a blank sheet of paper on which you can make it do\\nwhatever you like and have any symptoms or mutant ‘variants’ you\\nchoose to add while a real infectious agent would limit you to what\\nit actually does. A phantom disease allows you to have endless\\nludicrous ‘studies’ on the ‘Covid’ dollar to widen the perceived\\nimpact by inventing ever more ‘at risk’ groups including one study\\nwhich said those who walk slowly may be almost four times more\\nlikely to die from the ‘virus’. People are in psychiatric wards for less.\\nA real ‘deadly bioweapon’ can take out people in the hierarchy\\nthat are not part of the Cult, but essential to its operation. Obviously\\nthey don’t want that. Releasing a real disease means you\\nimmediately lose control of it. Releasing an illusory one means you\\ndon’t. Again it’s vital that people are extra careful when dealing with\\nwhat they want to hear. A bioweapon unleashed from a Chinese\\nlaboratory in collusion with the American Deep State may ﬁt a\\nconspiracy narrative, but is it true? Would it not be far more eﬀective\\nto use the excuse of a ‘virus’ to justify the real bioweapon – the\\n‘vaccine’? That way your disease agent does not have to be\\ntransmi\\x00ed and arrives directly through a syringe. I saw a French\\nvirologist Luc Montagnier quoted in the alternative media as saying\\nhe had discovered that the alleged ‘new’ severe acute respiratory\\nsyndrome coronavirus , or SARS-CoV-2, was made artiﬁcially and\\nincluded elements of the human immunodeﬁciency ‘virus’ (HIV)\\nand a parasite that causes malaria. SARS-CoV-2 is alleged to trigger\\nan alleged illness called Covid-19. I remembered Montagnier’s name\\nfrom my research years before into claims that an HIV ‘retrovirus’\\ncauses AIDs – claims that were demolished by Berkeley virologist\\nPeter Duesberg who showed that no one had ever proved that HIV\\ncauses acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome or AIDS. Claims that\\nbecome accepted as fact, publicly and medically, with no proof\\nwhatsoever are an ever-recurring story that profoundly applies to ‘Covid’. Nevertheless, despite the lack of proof, Montagnier’s team\\nat the Pasteur Institute in Paris had a long dispute with American\\nresearcher Robert Gallo over which of them discovered and isolated\\nthe HIV ‘virus’ and with no evidence found it to cause AIDS. You will\\nsee later that there is also no evidence that any ‘virus’ causes any\\ndisease or that there is even such a thing as a ‘virus’ in the way it is\\nsaid to exist. The claim to have ‘isolated’ the HIV ‘virus’ will be\\npresented in its real context as we come to the shocking story – and\\nit is a story – of SARS-CoV-2 and so will Montagnier’s assertion that\\nhe identiﬁed the full SARS-CoV-2 genome.\\nHoax in the making\\nWe can pick up the ‘Covid’ story in 2010 and the publication by the\\nRockefeller Foundation of a document called ‘Scenarios for the\\nFuture of Technology and International Development’. The inner\\ncircle of the Rockefeller family has been serving the Cult since John\\nD. Rockefeller (1839-1937) made his fortune with Standard Oil. It is\\nless well known that the same Rockefeller – the Bill Gates of his day\\n– was responsible for establishing what is now referred to as ‘Big\\nPharma’, the global network of pharmaceutical companies that make\\noutrageous proﬁts dispensing scalpel and drug ‘medicine’ and are\\nobsessed with pumping vaccines in ever-increasing number into as\\nmany human arms and backsides as possible. John D. Rockefeller\\nwas the driving force behind the creation of the ‘education’ system\\nin the United States and elsewhere speciﬁcally designed to program\\nthe perceptions of generations therea\\x00er. The Rockefeller family\\ndonated exceptionally valuable land in New York for the United\\nNations building and were central in establishing the World Health\\nOrganization in 1948 as an agency of the UN which was created\\nfrom the start as a Trojan horse and stalking horse for world\\ngovernment. Now enter Bill Gates. His family and the Rockefellers\\nhave long been extremely close and I have seen genealogy which\\nclaims that if you go back far enough the two families fuse into the\\nsame bloodline. Gates has said that the Bill and Melinda Gates\\nFoundation was inspired by the Rockefeller Foundation and why not when both are serving the same Cult? Major tax-exempt foundations\\nare overwhelmingly criminal enterprises in which Cult assets fund\\nthe Cult agenda in the guise of ‘philanthropy’ while avoiding tax in\\nthe process. Cult operatives can become mega-rich in their role of\\nfront men and women for the psychopaths at the inner core and\\nthey, too, have to be psychopaths to knowingly serve such evil. Part\\nof the deal is that a big percentage of the wealth gleaned from\\nrepresenting the Cult has to be spent advancing the ambitions of the\\nCult and hence you have the Rockefeller Foundation, Bill and\\nMelinda Gates Foundation (and so many more) and people like\\nGeorge Soros with his global Open Society Foundations spending\\ntheir billions in pursuit of global Cult control. Gates is a global\\npublic face of the Cult with his interventions in world aﬀairs\\nincluding Big Tech inﬂuence; a central role in the ‘Covid’ and\\n‘vaccine’ scam; promotion of the climate change shakedown;\\nmanipulation of education; geoengineering of the skies; and his\\nfood-control agenda as the biggest owner of farmland in America,\\nhis GMO promotion and through other means. As one writer said:\\n‘Gates monopolizes or wields disproportionate inﬂuence over the\\ntech industry, global health and vaccines, agriculture and food policy\\n(including biopiracy and fake food), weather modiﬁcation and other\\nclimate technologies, surveillance, education and media.’ The almost\\nlimitless wealth secured through Microso\\x00 and other not-allowed-\\nto-fail ventures (including vaccines) has been ploughed into a long,\\nlong list of Cult projects designed to enslave the entire human race.\\nGates and the Rockefellers have been working as one unit with the\\nRockefeller-established World Health Organization leading global\\n‘Covid’ policy controlled by Gates through his mouth-piece Tedros.\\nGates became the WHO’s biggest funder when Trump announced\\nthat the American government would cease its donations, but Biden\\nimmediately said he would restore the money when he took oﬃce in\\nJanuary, 2021. The Gates Foundation (the Cult) owns through\\nlimitless funding the world health system and the major players\\nacross the globe in the ‘Covid’ hoax. Okay, with that background we return to that Rockefeller\\nFoundation document of 2010 headed ‘Scenarios for the Future of\\nTechnology and International Development’ and its ‘imaginary’\\nepidemic of a virulent and deadly inﬂuenza strain which infected 20\\npercent of the global population and killed eight million in seven\\nmonths. The Rockefeller scenario was that the epidemic destroyed\\neconomies, closed shops, oﬃces and other businesses and led to\\ngovernments imposing ﬁerce rules and restrictions that included\\nmandatory wearing of face masks and body-temperature checks to\\nenter communal spaces like railway stations and supermarkets. The\\ndocument predicted that even a\\x00er the height of the Rockefeller-\\nenvisaged epidemic the authoritarian rule would continue to deal\\nwith further pandemics, transnational terrorism, environmental\\ncrises and rising poverty. Now you may think that the Rockefellers\\nare our modern-day seers or alternatively, and rather more likely,\\nthat they well knew what was planned a few years further on.\\nFascism had to be imposed, you see, to ‘protect citizens from risk\\nand exposure’. The Rockefeller scenario document said:\\nDuring the pandemic, national leaders around the world flexed their authority and imposed\\nairtight rules and restrictions, from the mandatory wearing of face masks to body-temperature\\nchecks at the entries to communal spaces like train stations and supermarkets. Even after the\\npandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities\\nstuck and even intensified. In order to protect themselves from the spread of increasingly\\nglobal problems – from pandemics and transnational terrorism to environmental crises and\\nrising poverty – leaders around the world took a firmer grip on power.\\nAt first, the notion of a more controlled world gained wide acceptance and approval. Citizens\\nwillingly gave up some of their sovereignty – and their privacy – to more paternalistic states in\\nexchange for greater safety and stability. Citizens were more tolerant, and even eager, for top-\\ndown direction and oversight, and national leaders had more latitude to impose order in the\\nways they saw fit.\\nIn developed countries, this heightened oversight took many forms: biometric IDs for all\\ncitizens, for example, and tighter regulation of key industries whose stability was deemed vital\\nto national interests. In many developed countries, enforced cooperation with a suite of new\\nregulations and agreements slowly but steadily restored both order and, importantly,\\neconomic growth. There we have the prophetic Rockefellers in 2010 and three years\\nlater came their paper for the Global Health Summit in Beĳing,\\nChina, when government representatives, the private sector,\\ninternational organisations and groups met to discuss the next 100\\nyears of ‘global health’. The Rockefeller Foundation-funded paper\\nwas called ‘Dreaming the Future of Health for the Next 100 Years\\nand more prophecy ensued as it described a dystopian future: ‘The\\nabundance of data, digitally tracking and linking people may mean\\nthe ‘death of privacy’ and may replace physical interaction with\\ntransient, virtual connection, generating isolation and raising\\nquestions of how values are shaped in virtual networks.’ Next in the\\n‘Covid’ hoax preparation sequence came a ‘table top’ simulation in\\n2018 for another ‘imaginary’ pandemic of a disease called Clade X\\nwhich was said to kill 900 million people. The exercise was\\norganised by the Gates-funded Johns Hopkins University’s Center\\nfor Health Security in the United States and this is the very same\\nuniversity that has been compiling the disgustingly and\\nsystematically erroneous global ﬁgures for ‘Covid’ cases and deaths.\\nSimilar Johns Hopkins health crisis scenarios have included the Dark\\nWinter exercise in 2001 and Atlantic Storm in 2005.\\nNostradamus 201\\nFor sheer predictive genius look no further prophecy-watchers than\\nthe Bill Gates-funded Event 201 held only six weeks before the\\n‘coronavirus pandemic’ is supposed to have broken out in China\\nand Event 201 was based on a scenario of a global ‘coronavirus\\npandemic’. Melinda Gates, the great man’s missus, told the BBC that\\nhe had ‘prepared for years’ for a coronavirus pandemic which told\\nus what we already knew. Nostradamugates had predicted in a TED\\ntalk in 2015 that a pandemic was coming that would kill a lot of\\npeople and demolish the world economy. My god, the man is a\\nmachine – possibly even literally. Now here he was only weeks\\nbefore the real thing funding just such a simulated scenario and\\ninvolving his friends and associates at Johns Hopkins, the World\\nEconomic Forum Cult-front of Klaus Schwab, the United Nations, Johnson & Johnson, major banks, and oﬃcials from China and the\\nCenters for Disease Control in the United States. What synchronicity\\n– Johns Hopkins would go on to compile the fraudulent ‘Covid’\\nﬁgures, the World Economic Forum and Schwab would push the\\n‘Great Reset’ in response to ‘Covid’, the Centers for Disease Control\\nwould be at the forefront of ‘Covid’ policy in the United States,\\nJohnson & Johnson would produce a ‘Covid vaccine’, and\\neverything would oﬃcially start just weeks later in China. Spooky,\\neh? They were even accurate in creating a simulation of a ‘virus’\\npandemic because the ‘real thing’ would also be a simulation. Event\\n201 was not an exercise preparing for something that might happen;\\nit was a rehearsal for what those in control knew was going to\\nhappen and very shortly. Hours of this simulation were posted on\\nthe Internet and the various themes and responses mirrored what\\nwould soon be imposed to transform human society. News stories\\nwere inserted and what they said would be commonplace a few\\nweeks later with still more prophecy perfection. Much discussion\\nfocused on the need to deal with misinformation and the ‘anti-vax\\nmovement’ which is exactly what happened when the ‘virus’ arrived\\n– was said to have arrived – in the West.\\nCult-owned social media banned criticism and exposure of the\\noﬃcial ‘virus’ narrative and when I said there was no ‘virus’ in early\\nApril, 2020, I was banned by one platform a\\x00er another including\\nYouTube, Facebook and later Twi\\x00er. The mainstream broadcast\\nmedia in Britain was in eﬀect banned from interviewing me by the\\nTony-Blair-created government broadcasting censor Ofcom headed\\nby career government bureaucrat Melanie Dawes who was\\nappointed just as the ‘virus’ hoax was about to play out in January,\\n2020. At the same time the Ickonic media platform was using Vimeo,\\nanother ultra-Zionist-owned operation, while our own player was\\nbeing created and they deleted in an instant hundreds of videos,\\ndocumentaries, series and shows to conﬁrm their unbelievable\\nvindictiveness. We had copies, of course, and they had to be restored\\none by one when our player was ready. These people have no class.\\nSabbatian Facebook promised free advertisements for the Gates- controlled World Health Organization narrative while deleting ‘false\\nclaims and conspiracy theories’ to stop ‘misinformation’ about the\\nalleged coronavirus. All these responses could be seen just a short\\nwhile earlier in the scenarios of Event 201. Extreme censorship was\\nabsolutely crucial for the Cult because the oﬃcial story was so\\nridiculous and unsupportable by the evidence that it could never\\nsurvive open debate and the free-ﬂow of information and opinion. If\\nyou can’t win a debate then don’t have one is the Cult’s approach\\nthroughout history. Facebook’s li\\x00le boy front man – front boy –\\nMark Zuckerberg equated ‘credible and accurate information’ with\\noﬃcial sources and exposing their lies with ‘misinformation’.\\nSilencing those that can see\\nThe censorship dynamic of Event 201 is now the norm with an army\\nof narrative-supporting ‘fact-checker’ organisations whose entire\\nreason for being is to tell the public that oﬃcial narratives are true\\nand those exposing them are lying. One of the most appalling of\\nthese ‘fact-checkers’ is called NewsGuard founded by ultra-Zionist\\nAmericans Gordon Crovitz and Steven Brill. Crovitz is a former\\npublisher of The Wall Street Journal, former Executive Vice President\\nof Dow Jones, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR),\\nand on the board of the American Association of Rhodes Scholars.\\nThe CFR and Rhodes Scholarships, named a\\x00er Rothschild agent\\nCecil Rhodes who plundered the gold and diamonds of South Africa\\nfor his masters and the Cult, have featured widely in my books.\\nNewsGuard don’t seem to like me for some reason – I really can’t\\nthink why – and they have done all they can to have me censored\\nand discredited which is, to quote an old British politician, like being\\nsavaged by a dead sheep. They are, however, like all in the\\ncensorship network, very well connected and funded by\\norganisations themselves funded by, or connected to, Bill Gates. As\\nyou would expect with anything associated with Gates NewsGuard\\nhas an oﬀshoot called HealthGuard which ‘ﬁghts online health care\\nhoaxes’. How very kind. Somehow the NewsGuard European\\nManaging Director Anna-Sophie Harling, a remarkably young- looking woman with no broadcasting experience and li\\x00le hands-on\\nwork in journalism, has somehow secured a position on the ‘Content\\nBoard’ of UK government broadcast censor Ofcom. An executive of\\nan organisation seeking to discredit dissidents of the oﬃcial\\nnarratives is making decisions for the government broadcast\\n‘regulator’ about content?? Another appalling ‘fact-checker’ is Full\\nFact funded by George Soros and global censors Google and\\nFacebook.\\nIt’s amazing how many activists in the ‘fact-checking’, ‘anti-hate’,\\narena turn up in government-related positions – people like UK\\nLabour Party activist Imran Ahmed who heads the Center for\\nCountering Digital Hate founded by people like Morgan\\nMcSweeney, now chief of staﬀ to the Labour Party’s hapless and\\nuseless ‘leader’ Keir Starmer. Digital Hate – which is what it really is\\n– uses the American spelling of Center to betray its connection to a\\ntransatlantic network of similar organisations which in 2020\\nshapeshi\\x00ed from a\\x00acking people for ‘hate’ to a\\x00acking them for\\nquestioning the ‘Covid’ hoax and the dangers of the ‘Covid vaccine’.\\nIt’s just a coincidence, you understand. This is one of Imran Ahmed’s\\nhysterical statements: ‘I would go beyond calling anti-vaxxers\\nconspiracy theorists to say they are an extremist group that pose a\\nnational security risk.’ No one could ever accuse this prat of\\nunderstatement and he’s including in that those parents who are\\nnow against vaccines a\\x00er their children were damaged for life or\\nkilled by them. He’s such a nice man. Ahmed does the rounds of the\\nWoke media ge\\x00ing so\\x00-ball questions from spineless ‘journalists’\\nwho never ask what right he has to campaign to destroy the freedom\\nof speech of others while he demands it for himself. There also\\nseems to be an overrepresentation in Ofcom of people connected to\\nthe narrative-worshipping BBC. This incredible global network of\\nnarrative-support was super-vital when the ‘Covid’ hoax was played\\nin the light of the mega-whopper lies that have to be defended from\\nthe spotlight cast by the most basic intelligence.\\nSetting the scene The Cult plays the long game and proceeds step-by-step ensuring\\nthat everything is in place before major cards are played and they\\ndon’t come any bigger than the ‘Covid’ hoax. The psychopaths can’t\\nhandle events where the outcome isn’t certain and as li\\x00le as\\npossible – preferably nothing – is le\\x00 to chance. Politicians,\\ngovernment and medical oﬃcials who would follow direction were\\nbrought to illusory power in advance by the Cult web whether on\\nthe national stage or others like state governors and mayors of\\nAmerica. For decades the dynamic between oﬃcialdom, law\\nenforcement and the public was changed from one of service to one\\nof control and dictatorship. Behaviour manipulation networks\\nestablished within government were waiting to impose the coming\\n‘Covid’ rules and regulations speciﬁcally designed to subdue and\\nrewire the psyche of the people in the guise of protecting health.\\nThese included in the UK the Behavioural Insights Team part-owned\\nby the British government Cabinet Oﬃce; the Scientiﬁc Pandemic\\nInsights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B); and a whole web of\\nintelligence and military groups seeking to direct the conversation\\non social media and control the narrative. Among them are the\\ncyberwarfare (on the people) 77th Brigade of the British military\\nwhich is also coordinated through the Cabinet Oﬃce as civilian and\\nmilitary leadership continues to combine in what they call the\\nFusion Doctrine. The 77th Brigade is a British equivalent of the\\ninfamous Israeli (Sabbatian) military cyberwarfare and Internet\\nmanipulation operation Unit 8200 which I expose at length in The\\nTrigger. Also carefully in place were the medical and science advisers\\nto government – many on the payroll past or present of Bill Gates –\\nand a whole alternative structure of unelected government stood by\\nto take control when elected parliaments were eﬀectively closed\\ndown once the ‘Covid’ card was slammed on the table. The structure\\nI have described here and so much more was installed in every\\nmajor country through the Cult networks. The top-down control\\nhierarchy looks like this: The Cult – Cult-owned Gates – the World\\nHealth Organization and Tedros – Gates-funded or controlled chief\\nmedical oﬃcers and science ‘advisers’ (dictators) in each country – political ‘leaders’– law enforcement – The People. Through this\\nsimple global communication and enforcement structure the policy\\nof the Cult could be imposed on virtually the entire human\\npopulation so long as they acquiesced to the fascism. With\\neverything in place it was time for the bu\\x00on to be pressed in late\\n2019/early 2020.\\nThese were the prime goals the Cult had to secure for its will to\\nprevail:\\n1) Locking down economies, closing all but designated ‘essential’ businesses (Cult-owned\\ncorporations were ‘essential’), and pu\\x00ing the population under house arrest was an\\nimperative to destroy independent income and employment and ensure dependency on the\\nCult-controlled state in the Hunger Games Society. Lockdowns had to be established as the\\nglobal blueprint from the start to respond to the ‘virus’ and followed by pre\\x00y much the\\nentire world.\\n2) The global population had to be terriﬁed into believing in a deadly ‘virus’ that didn’t\\nactually exist so they would unquestioningly obey authority in the belief that authority\\nmust know how best to protect them and their families. So\\x00ware salesman Gates would\\nsuddenly morph into the world’s health expert and be promoted as such by the Cult-owned\\nmedia.\\n3) A method of testing that wasn’t testing for the ‘virus’, but was only claimed to be, had to\\nbe in place to provide the illusion of ‘cases’ and subsequent ‘deaths’ that had a very\\ndiﬀerent cause to the ‘Covid-19’ that would be scribbled on the death certiﬁcate.\\n4) Because there was no ‘virus’ and the great majority testing positive with a test not testing\\nfor the ‘virus’ would have no symptoms of anything the lie had to be sold that people\\nwithout symptoms (without the ‘virus’) could still pass it on to others. This was crucial to\\njustify for the ﬁrst time quarantining – house arresting – healthy people. Without this the\\neconomy-destroying lockdown of everybody could not have been credibly sold.\\n5) The ‘saviour’ had to be seen as a vaccine which beyond evil drug companies were\\nworking like angels of mercy to develop as quickly as possible, with all corners cut, to save\\nthe day. The public must absolutely not know that the ‘vaccine’ had nothing to do with a\\n‘virus’ or that the contents were ready and waiting with a very diﬀerent motive long before\\nthe ‘Covid’ card was even li\\x00ed from the pack.\\nI said in March, 2020, that the ‘vaccine’ would have been created\\nway ahead of the ‘Covid’ hoax which justiﬁed its use and the\\nfollowing December an article in the New York Intelligencer\\nmagazine said the Moderna ‘vaccine’ had been ‘designed’ by January, 2020. This was ‘before China had even acknowledged that\\nthe disease could be transmi\\x00ed from human to human, more than a\\nweek before the ﬁrst conﬁrmed coronavirus case in the United\\nStates’. The article said that by the time the ﬁrst American death was\\nannounced a month later ‘the vaccine had already been\\nmanufactured and shipped to the National Institutes of Health for\\nthe beginning of its Phase I clinical trial’. The ‘vaccine’ was actually\\n‘designed’ long before that although even with this timescale you\\nwould expect the article to ask how on earth it could have been done\\nthat quickly. Instead it asked why the ‘vaccine’ had not been rolled\\nout then and not months later. Journalism in the mainstream is truly\\ndead. I am going to detail in the next chapter why the ‘virus’ has\\nnever existed and how a hoax on that scale was possible, but ﬁrst the\\nfoundation on which the Big Lie of ‘Covid’ was built.\\nThe test that doesn’t test\\nFraudulent ‘testing’ is the bo\\x00om line of the whole ‘Covid’ hoax and\\nwas the means by which a ‘virus’ that did not exist appeared to exist.\\nThey could only achieve this magic trick by using a test not testing\\nfor the ‘virus’. To use a test that was testing for the ‘virus’ would\\nmean that every test would come back negative given there was no\\n‘virus’. They chose to exploit something called the RT-PCR test\\ninvented by American biochemist Kary Mullis in the 1980s who said\\npublicly that his PCR test … cannot detect infectious disease. Yes, the\\n‘test’ used worldwide to detect infectious ‘Covid’ to produce all the\\nillusory ‘cases’ and ‘deaths’ compiled by Johns Hopkins and others\\ncannot detect infectious disease. This fact came from the mouth of the\\nman who invented PCR and was awarded the Nobel Prize in\\nChemistry in 1993 for doing so. Sadly, and incredibly conveniently\\nfor the Cult, Mullis died in August, 2019, at the age of 74 just before\\nhis test would be fraudulently used to unleash fascism on the world.\\nHe was said to have died from pneumonia which was an irony in\\nitself. A few months later he would have had ‘Covid-19’ on his death\\ncertiﬁcate. I say the timing of his death was convenient because had\\nhe lived Mullis, a brilliant, honest and decent man, would have been vociferously speaking out against the use of his test to detect ‘Covid’\\nwhen it was never designed, or able, to do that. I know that to be\\ntrue given that Mullis made the same point when his test was used\\nto ‘detect’ – not detect – HIV. He had been seriously critical of the\\nGallo/Montagnier claim to have isolated the HIV ‘virus’ and shown\\nit to cause AIDS for which Mullis said there was no evidence. AIDS\\nis actually not a disease but a series of diseases from which people\\ndie all the time. When they die from those same diseases a\\x00er a\\npositive ‘test’ for HIV then AIDS goes on their death certiﬁcate. I\\nthink I’ve heard that before somewhere. Countries instigated a\\npolicy with ‘Covid’ that anyone who tested positive with a test not\\ntesting for the ‘virus’ and died of any other cause within 28 days and\\neven longer ‘Covid-19’ had to go on the death certiﬁcate. Cases have\\ncome from the test that can’t test for infectious disease and the\\ndeaths are those who have died of anything a\\x00er testing positive\\nwith a test not testing for the ‘virus’. I’ll have much more later about\\nthe death certiﬁcate scandal.\\nMullis was deeply dismissive of the now US ‘Covid’ star Anthony\\nFauci who he said was a liar who didn’t know anything about\\nanything – ‘and I would say that to his face – nothing.’ He said of\\nFauci: ‘The man thinks he can take a blood sample, put it in an\\nelectron microscope and if it’s got a virus in there you’ll know it – he\\ndoesn’t understand electron microscopy and he doesn’t understand\\nmedicine and shouldn’t be in a position like he’s in.’ That position,\\nterrifyingly, has made him the decider of ‘Covid’ fascism policy on\\nbehalf of the Cult in his role as director since 1984 of the National\\nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) while his record\\nof being wrong is laughable; but being wrong, so long as it’s the right\\nkind of wrong, is why the Cult loves him. He’ll say anything the Cult\\ntells him to say. Fauci was made Chief Medical Adviser to the\\nPresident immediately Biden took oﬃce. Biden was installed in the\\nWhite House by Cult manipulation and one of his ﬁrst decisions was\\nto elevate Fauci to a position of even more control. This is a\\ncoincidence? Yes, and I identify as a ﬂamenco dancer called Lola.\\nHow does such an incompetent criminal like Fauci remain in that pivotal position in American health since the 1980s? When you serve\\nthe Cult it looks a\\x00er you until you are surplus to requirements.\\nKary Mullis said prophetically of Fauci and his like: ‘Those guys\\nhave an agenda and it’s not an agenda we would like them to have\\n… they make their own rules, they change them when they want to,\\nand Tony Fauci does not mind going on television in front of the\\npeople who pay his salary and lie directly into the camera.’ Fauci has\\ndone that almost daily since the ‘Covid’ hoax began. Lying is in\\nFauci’s DNA. To make the situation crystal clear about the PCR test\\nthis is a direct quote from its inventor Kary Mullis:\\nIt [the PCR test] doesn’t tell you that you’re sick and doesn’t tell you that the thing you ended\\nup with was really going to hurt you ...’\\nAsk yourself why governments and medical systems the world over\\nhave been using this very test to decide who is ‘infected’ with the\\nSARS-CoV-2 ‘virus’ and the alleged disease it allegedly causes,\\n‘Covid-19’. The answer to that question will tell you what has been\\ngoing on. By the way, here’s a li\\x00le show-stopper – the ‘new’ SARS-\\nCoV-2 ‘virus’ was ‘identiﬁed’ as such right from the start using … the\\nPCR test not testing for the ‘virus’. If you are new to this and ﬁnd that\\nshocking then stick around. I have hardly started yet. Even worse,\\nother ‘tests’, like the ‘Lateral Flow Device’ (LFD), are considered so\\nuseless that they have to be confirmed by the PCR test! Leaked emails\\nwri\\x00en by Ben Dyson, adviser to UK ‘Health’ Secretary Ma\\x00\\nHancock, said they were ‘dangerously unreliable’. Dyson, executive\\ndirector of strategy at the Department of Health, wrote: ‘As of today,\\nsomeone who gets a positive LFD result in (say) London has at best a\\n25 per cent chance of it being a true positive, but if it is a self-\\nreported test potentially as low as 10 per cent (on an optimistic\\nassumption about speciﬁcity) or as low as 2 per cent (on a more\\npessimistic assumption).’ These are the ‘tests’ that schoolchildren\\nand the public are being urged to have twice a week or more and\\nhave to isolate if they get a positive. Each fake positive goes in the\\nstatistics as a ‘case’ no ma\\x00er how ludicrously inaccurate and the ‘cases’ drive lockdown, masks and the pressure to ‘vaccinate’. The\\ngovernment said in response to the email leak that the ‘tests’ were\\naccurate which conﬁrmed yet again what shocking bloody liars they\\nare. The real false positive rate is 100 percent as we’ll see. In another\\n‘you couldn’t make it up’ the UK government agreed to pay £2.8\\nbillion to California’s Innova Medical Group to supply the irrelevant\\nlateral ﬂow tests. The company’s primary test-making centre is in\\nChina. Innova Medical Group, established in March, 2020, is owned\\nby Pasaca Capital Inc, chaired by Chinese-American millionaire\\nCharles Huang who was born in Wuhan.\\nHow it works – and how it doesn’t\\nThe RT-PCR test, known by its full title of Polymerase chain reaction,\\nis used across the world to make millions, even billions, of copies of\\na DNA/RNA genetic information sample. The process is called\\n‘ampliﬁcation’ and means that a tiny sample of genetic material is\\nampliﬁed to bring out the detailed content. I stress that it is not\\ntesting for an infectious disease. It is simply amplifying a sample of\\ngenetic material. In the words of Kary Mullis: ‘PCR is … just a\\nprocess that’s used to make a whole lot of something out of\\nsomething.’ To emphasise the point companies that make the PCR\\ntests circulated around the world to ‘test’ for ‘Covid’ warn on the\\nbox that it can’t be used to detect ‘Covid’ or infectious disease and is\\nfor research purposes only. It’s okay, rest for a minute and you’ll be\\nﬁne. This is the test that produces the ‘cases’ and ‘deaths’ that have\\nbeen used to destroy human society. All those global and national\\nmedical and scientiﬁc ‘experts’ demanding this destruction to ‘save\\nus’ KNOW that the test is not testing for the ‘virus’ and the cases and\\ndeaths they claim to be real are an almost unimaginable fraud. Every\\none of them and so many others including politicians and\\npsychopaths like Gates and Tedros must be brought before\\nNuremburg-type trials and jailed for the rest of their lives. The more\\nthe genetic sample is ampliﬁed by PCR the more elements of that\\nmaterial become sensitive to the test and by that I don’t mean\\nsensitive for a ‘virus’ but for elements of the genetic material which is naturally in the body or relates to remnants of old conditions of\\nvarious kinds lying dormant and causing no disease. Once the\\nampliﬁcation of the PCR reaches a certain level everyone will test\\npositive. So much of the material has been made sensitive to the test\\nthat everyone will have some part of it in their body. Even lying\\ncriminals like Fauci have said that once PCR ampliﬁcations pass 35\\ncycles everything will be a false positive that cannot be trusted for\\nthe reasons I have described. I say, like many proper doctors and\\nscientists, that 100 percent of the ‘positives’ are false, but let’s just go\\nwith Fauci for a moment.\\nHe says that any ampliﬁcation over 35 cycles will produce false\\npositives and yet the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) have recommended up to 40\\ncycles and the National Health Service (NHS) in Britain admi\\x00ed in\\nan internal document for staﬀ that it was using 45 cycles of\\nampliﬁcation. A long list of other countries has been doing the same\\nand at least one ‘testing’ laboratory has been using 50 cycles. Have\\nyou ever heard a doctor, medical ‘expert’ or the media ask what level\\nof ampliﬁcation has been used to claim a ‘positive’. The ‘test’ comes\\nback ‘positive’ and so you have the ‘virus’, end of story. Now we can\\nsee how the government in Tanzania could send oﬀ samples from a\\ngoat and a pawpaw fruit under human names and both came back\\npositive for ‘Covid-19’. Tanzania president John Magufuli mocked\\nthe ‘Covid’ hysteria, the PCR test and masks and refused to import\\nthe DNA-manipulating ‘vaccine’. The Cult hated him and an article\\nsponsored by the Bill Gates Foundation appeared in the London\\nGuardian in February, 2021, headed ‘It’s time for Africa to rein in\\nTanzania’s anti-vaxxer president’. Well, ‘reined in’ he shortly was.\\nMagufuli appeared in good health, but then, in March, 2021, he was\\ndead at 61 from ‘heart failure’. He was replaced by Samia Hassan\\nSuhulu who is connected to Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum\\nand she immediately reversed Magufuli’s ‘Covid’ policy. A sample of\\ncola tested positive for ‘Covid’ with the PCR test in Germany while\\nAmerican actress and singer-songwriter Erykah Badu tested positive\\nin one nostril and negative in the other. Footballer Ronaldo called the PCR test ‘bullshit’ a\\x00er testing positive three times and being\\nforced to quarantine and miss matches when there was nothing\\nwrong with him. The mantra from Tedros at the World Health\\nOrganization and national governments (same thing) has been test,\\ntest, test. They know that the more tests they can generate the more\\nfake ‘cases’ they have which go on to become ‘deaths’ in ways I am\\ncoming to. The UK government has its Operation Moonshot planned\\nto test multiple millions every day in workplaces and schools with\\nfree tests for everyone to use twice a week at home in line with the\\nCult plan from the start to make testing part of life. A government\\nadvertisement for an ‘Interim Head of Asymptomatic Testing\\nCommunication’ said the job included responsibility for delivering a\\n‘communications strategy’ (propaganda) ‘to support the expansion\\nof asymptomatic testing that ‘normalises testing as part of everyday life’.\\nMore tests means more fake ‘cases’, ‘deaths’ and fascism. I have\\nheard of, and from, many people who booked a test, couldn’t turn\\nup, and yet got a positive result through the post for a test they’d\\nnever even had. The whole thing is crazy, but for the Cult there’s\\nmethod in the madness. Controlling and manipulating the level of\\nampliﬁcation of the test means the authorities can control whenever\\nthey want the number of apparent ‘cases’ and ‘deaths’. If they want\\nto justify more fascist lockdown and destruction of livelihoods they\\nkeep the ampliﬁcation high. If they want to give the illusion that\\nlockdowns and the ‘vaccine’ are working then they lower the\\nampliﬁcation and ‘cases’ and ‘deaths’ will appear to fall. In January,\\n2021, the Cult-owned World Health Organization suddenly warned\\nlaboratories about over-ampliﬁcation of the test and to lower the\\nthreshold. Suddenly headlines began appearing such as: ‘Why ARE\\n“Covid” cases plummeting?’ This was just when the vaccine rollout\\nwas underway and I had predicted months before they would make\\ncases appear to fall through ampliﬁcation tampering when the\\n‘vaccine’ came. These people are so predictable.\\nCow vaccines? The question must be asked of what is on the test swabs being poked\\nfar up the nose of the population to the base of the brain? A nasal\\nswab punctured one woman’s brain and caused it to leak ﬂuid. Most\\nof these procedures are being done by people with li\\x00le training or\\nmedical knowledge. Dr Lorraine Day, former orthopaedic trauma\\nsurgeon and Chief of Orthopaedic Surgery at San Francisco General\\nHospital, says the tests are really a ‘vaccine’. Cows have long been\\nvaccinated this way. She points out that masks have to cover the nose\\nand the mouth where it is claimed the ‘virus’ exists in saliva. Why\\nthen don’t they take saliva from the mouth as they do with a DNA\\ntest instead of pushing a long swab up the nose towards the brain?\\nThe ethmoid bone separates the nasal cavity from the brain and\\nwithin that bone is the cribriform plate. Dr Day says that when the\\nswab is pushed up against this plate and twisted the procedure is\\n‘depositing things back there’. She claims that among these ‘things’\\nare nanoparticles that can enter the brain. Researchers have noted\\nthat a team at the Gates-funded Johns Hopkins have designed tiny,\\nstar-shaped micro-devices that can latch onto intestinal mucosa and\\nrelease drugs into the body. Mucosa is the thin skin that covers the\\ninside surface of parts of the body such as the nose and mouth and\\nproduces mucus to protect them. The Johns Hopkins micro-devices\\nare called ‘theragrippers’ and were ‘inspired’ by a parasitic worm\\nthat digs its sharp teeth into a host’s intestines. Nasal swabs are also\\ncoated in the sterilisation agent ethylene oxide. The US National\\nCancer Institute posts this explanation on its website:\\nAt room temperature, ethylene oxide is a flammable colorless gas with a sweet odor. It is used\\nprimarily to produce other chemicals, including antifreeze. In smaller amounts, ethylene\\noxide is used as a pesticide and a sterilizing agent. The ability of ethylene oxide to damage\\nDNA makes it an effective sterilizing agent but also accounts for its cancer-causing activity.\\nThe Institute mentions lymphoma and leukaemia as cancers most\\nfrequently reported to be associated with occupational exposure to\\nethylene oxide along with stomach and breast cancers. How does\\nanyone think this is going to work out with the constant testing regime being inﬂicted on adults and children at home and at school\\nthat will accumulate in the body anything that’s on the swab?\\nDoctors know best\\nIt is vital for people to realise that ‘hero’ doctors ‘know’ only what\\nthe Big Pharma-dominated medical authorities tell them to ‘know’\\nand if they refuse to ‘know’ what they are told to ‘know’ they are out\\nthe door. They are mostly not physicians or healers, but repeaters of\\nthe oﬃcial narrative – or else. I have seen alleged professional\\ndoctors on British television make shocking statements that we are\\nsupposed to take seriously. One called ‘Dr’ Amir Khan, who is\\nactually telling patients how to respond to illness, said that men\\ncould take the birth pill to ‘help slow down the eﬀects of Covid-19’.\\nIn March, 2021, another ridiculous ‘Covid study’ by an American\\ndoctor proposed injecting men with the female sex hormone\\nprogesterone as a ‘Covid’ treatment. British doctor Nighat Arif told\\nthe BBC that face coverings were now going to be part of ongoing\\nnormal. Yes, the vaccine protects you, she said (evidence?) … but the\\nway to deal with viruses in the community was always going to\\ncome down to hand washing, face covering and keeping a physical\\ndistance. That’s not what we were told before the ‘vaccine’ was\\ncirculating. Arif said she couldn’t imagine ever again going on the\\nunderground or in a li\\x00 without a mask. I was just thanking my\\ngood luck that she was not my doctor when she said – in March,\\n2021 – that if ‘we are behaving and we are doing all the right things’\\nshe thought we could ‘have our nearest and dearest around us at\\nhome … around Christmas and New Year! Her patronising delivery\\nwas the usual school teacher talking to six-year-olds as she repeated\\nevery government talking point and probably believed them all. If\\nwe have learned anything from the ‘Covid’ experience surely it must\\nbe that humanity’s perception of doctors needs a fundamental\\nrethink. NHS ‘doctor’ Sara Kayat told her television audience that\\nthe ‘Covid vaccine’ would ‘100 percent prevent hospitalisation and\\ndeath’. Not even Big Pharma claimed that. We have to stop taking\\n‘experts’ at their word without question when so many of them are clueless and only repeating the party line on which their careers\\ndepend. That is not to say there are not brilliants doctors – there are\\nand I have spoken to many of them since all this began – but you\\nwon’t see them in the mainstream media or quoted by the\\npsychopaths and yes-people in government.\\nRemember the name – Christian Drosten\\nGerman virologist Christian Drosten, Director of Charité Institute of\\nVirology in Berlin, became a national star a\\x00er the pandemic hoax\\nbegan. He was feted on television and advised the German\\ngovernment on ‘Covid’ policy. Most importantly to the wider world\\nDrosten led a group that produced the ‘Covid’ testing protocol for\\nthe PCR test. What a remarkable feat given the PCR cannot test for\\ninfectious disease and even more so when you think that Drosten\\nsaid that his method of testing for SARS-CoV-2 was developed\\n‘without having virus material available’. He developed a test for a\\n‘virus’ that he didn’t have and had never seen. Let that sink in as you\\nsurvey the global devastation that came from what he did. The\\nwhole catastrophe of Drosten’s ‘test’ was based on the alleged\\ngenetic sequence published by Chinese scientists on the Internet. We\\nwill see in the next chapter that this alleged ‘genetic sequence’ has\\nnever been produced by China or anyone and cannot be when there\\nis no SARS-CoV-2. Drosten, however, doesn’t seem to let li\\x00le details\\nlike that get in the way. He was the lead author with Victor Corman\\nfrom the same Charité Hospital of the paper ‘Detection of 2019 novel\\ncoronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time PCR‘ published in a magazine\\ncalled Eurosurveillance. This became known as the Corman-Drosten\\npaper. In November, 2020, with human society devastated by the\\neﬀects of the Corman-Drosten test baloney, the protocol was publicly\\nchallenged by 22 international scientists and independent\\nresearchers from Europe, the United States, and Japan. Among them\\nwere senior molecular geneticists, biochemists, immunologists, and\\nmicrobiologists. They produced a document headed ‘External peer\\nreview of the RTPCR test to detect SARS-Cov-2 Reveals 10 Major\\nFlaws At The Molecular and Methodological Level: Consequences •\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nFor False-Positive Results’. The ﬂaws in the Corman-Drosten test\\nincluded the following:\\n \\nThe test is non-speciﬁc because of erroneous design\\nResults are enormously variable\\nThe test is unable to discriminate between the whole ‘virus’ and\\nviral fragments\\nIt doesn’t have positive or negative controls\\nThe test lacks a standard operating procedure\\nIt is unsupported by proper peer view\\n \\nThe scientists said the PCR ‘Covid’ testing protocol was not\\nfounded on science and they demanded the Corman-Drosten paper\\nbe retracted by Eurosurveillance. They said all present and previous\\nCovid deaths, cases, and ‘infection rates’ should be subject to a\\nmassive retroactive inquiry. Lockdowns and travel restrictions\\nshould be reviewed and relaxed and those diagnosed through PCR\\nto have ‘Covid-19’ should not be forced to isolate. Dr Kevin Corbe\\x00,\\na health researcher and nurse educator with a long academic career\\nproducing a stream of peer-reviewed publications at many UK\\nuniversities, made the same point about the PCR test debacle. He\\nsaid of the scientists’ conclusions: ‘Every scientiﬁc rationale for the\\ndevelopment of that test has been totally destroyed by this paper. It’s\\nlike Hiroshima/Nagasaki to the Covid test.’ He said that China\\nhadn’t given them an isolated ‘virus’ when Drosten developed the\\ntest. Instead they had developed the test from a sequence in a gene\\nbank.’ Put another way … they made it up! The scientists were\\nsupported in this contention by a Portuguese appeals court which\\nruled in November, 2020, that PCR tests are unreliable and it is\\nunlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test. The point\\nabout China not providing an isolated virus must be true when the\\n‘virus’ has never been isolated to this day and the consequences of\\nthat will become clear. Drosten and company produced this useless\\n‘protocol’ right on cue in January, 2020, just as the ‘virus’ was said to be moving westward and it somehow managed to successfully pass\\na peer-review in 24 hours. In other words there was no peer-review\\nfor a test that would be used to decide who had ‘Covid’ and who\\ndidn’t across the world. The Cult-created, Gates-controlled World\\nHealth Organization immediately recommended all its nearly 200\\nmember countries to use the Drosten PCR protocol to detect ‘cases’\\nand ‘deaths’. The sting was underway and it continues to this day.\\nSo who is this Christian Drosten that produced the means through\\nwhich death, destruction and economic catastrophe would be\\njustiﬁed? His education background, including his doctoral thesis,\\nwould appear to be somewhat shrouded in mystery and his track\\nrecord is dire as with another essential player in the ‘Covid’ hoax,\\nthe Gates-funded Professor Neil Ferguson at the Gates-funded\\nImperial College in London of whom more shortly. Drosten\\npredicted in 2003 that the alleged original SARS ‘virus’ (SARS-1’)\\nwas an epidemic that could have serious eﬀects on economies and an\\neﬀective vaccine would take at least two years to produce. Drosten’s\\nanswer to every alleged ‘outbreak’ is a vaccine which you won’t be\\nshocked to know. What followed were just 774 oﬃcial deaths\\nworldwide and none in Germany where there were only nine cases.\\nThat is even if you believe there ever was a SARS ‘virus’ when the\\nevidence is zilch and I will expand on this in the next chapter.\\nDrosten claims to be co-discoverer of ‘SARS-1’ and developed a test\\nfor it in 2003. He was screaming warnings about ‘swine ﬂu’ in 2009\\nand how it was a widespread infection far more severe than any\\ndangers from a vaccine could be and people should get vaccinated. It\\nwould be helpful for Drosten’s vocal chords if he simply recorded\\nthe words ‘the virus is deadly and you need to get vaccinated’ and\\ncopies could be handed out whenever the latest made-up threat\\ncomes along. Drosten’s swine ﬂu epidemic never happened, but Big\\nPharma didn’t mind with governments spending hundreds of\\nmillions on vaccines that hardly anyone bothered to use and many\\nwho did wished they hadn’t. A study in 2010 revealed that the risk\\nof dying from swine ﬂu, or H1N1, was no higher than that of the\\nannual seasonal ﬂu which is what at least most of ‘it’ really was as in the case of ‘Covid-19’. A media investigation into Drosten asked\\nhow with such a record of inaccuracy he could be the government\\nadviser on these issues. The answer to that question is the same with\\nDrosten, Ferguson and Fauci – they keep on giving the authorities\\nthe ‘conclusions’ and ‘advice’ they want to hear. Drosten certainly\\nproduced the goods for them in January, 2020, with his PCR protocol\\ngarbage and provided the foundation of what German internal\\nmedicine specialist Dr Claus Köhnlein, co-author of Virus Mania,\\ncalled the ‘test pandemic’. The 22 scientists in the Eurosurveillance\\nchallenge called out conﬂicts of interest within the Drosten ‘protocol’\\ngroup and with good reason. Olfert Landt, a regular co-author of\\nDrosten ‘studies’, owns the biotech company TIB Molbiol\\nSyntheselabor GmbH in Berlin which manufactures and sells the\\ntests that Drosten and his mates come up with. They have done this\\nwith SARS, Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), MERS, Zika ‘virus’,\\nyellow fever, and now ‘Covid’. Landt told the Berliner Zeitung\\nnewspaper:\\nThe testing, design and development came from the Charité [Drosten and Corman]. We\\nsimply implemented it immediately in the form of a kit. And if we don’t have the virus, which\\noriginally only existed in Wuhan, we can make a synthetic gene to simulate the genome of the\\nvirus. That’s what we did very quickly.\\nThis is more conﬁrmation that the Drosten test was designed\\nwithout access to the ‘virus’ and only a synthetic simulation which is\\nwhat SARS-CoV-2 really is – a computer-generated synthetic ﬁction.\\nIt’s quite an enterprise they have going here. A Drosten team decides\\nwhat the test for something should be and Landt’s biotech company\\nﬂogs it to governments and medical systems across the world. His\\ncompany must have made an absolute fortune since the ‘Covid’ hoax\\nbegan. Dr Reiner Fuellmich, a prominent German consumer\\nprotection trial lawyer in Germany and California, is on Drosten’s\\ncase and that of Tedros at the World Health Organization for crimes\\nagainst humanity with a class-action lawsuit being prepared in the\\nUnited States and other legal action in Germany. Why China?\\nScamming the world with a ‘virus’ that doesn’t exist would seem\\nimpossible on the face of it, but not if you have control of the\\nrelatively few people that make policy decisions and the great\\nmajority of the global media. Remember it’s not about changing\\n‘real’ reality it’s about controlling perception of reality. You don’t have\\nto make something happen you only have make people believe that\\nit’s happening. Renegade Minds understand this and are therefore\\nmuch harder to swindle. ‘Covid-19’ is not a ‘real’ ‘virus’. It’s a mind\\nvirus, like a computer virus, which has infected the minds, not the\\nbodies, of billions. It all started, publically at least, in China and that\\nalone is of central signiﬁcance. The Cult was behind the revolution\\nled by its asset Mao Zedong, or Chairman Mao, which established\\nthe People’s Republic of China on October 1st, 1949. It should have\\nbeen called The Cult’s Republic of China, but the name had to reﬂect\\nthe recurring illusion that vicious dictatorships are run by and for\\nthe people (see all the ‘Democratic Republics’ controlled by tyrants).\\nIn the same way we have the ‘Biden’ Democratic Republic of\\nAmerica oﬃcially ruled by a puppet tyrant (at least temporarily) on\\nbehalf of Cult tyrants. The creation of Mao’s merciless\\ncommunist/fascist dictatorship was part of a frenzy of activity by the\\nCult at the conclusion of World War Two which, like the First World\\nWar, it had instigated through its assets in Germany, Britain, France,\\nthe United States and elsewhere. Israel was formed in 1948; the\\nSoviet Union expanded its ‘Iron Curtain’ control, inﬂuence and\\nmilitary power with the Warsaw Pact communist alliance in 1955;\\nthe United Nations was formed in 1945 as a Cult precursor to world\\ngovernment; and a long list of world bodies would be established\\nincluding the World Health Organization (1948), World Trade\\nOrganization (1948 under another name until 1995), International\\nMonetary Fund (1945) and World Bank (1944). Human society was\\nredrawn and hugely centralised in the global Problem-Reaction-\\nSolution that was World War Two. All these changes were\\nsigniﬁcant. Israel would become the headquarters of the Sabbatians and the revolution in China would prepare the ground and control\\nsystem for the events of 2019/2020.\\nRenegade Minds know there are no borders except for public\\nconsumption. The Cult is a seamless, borderless global entity and to\\nunderstand the game we need to put aside labels like borders,\\nnations, countries, communism, fascism and democracy. These\\ndelude the population into believing that countries are ruled within\\ntheir borders by a government of whatever shade when these are\\nmere agencies of a global power. America’s illusion of democracy\\nand China’s communism/fascism are subsidiaries – vehicles – for the\\nsame agenda. We may hear about conﬂict and competition between\\nAmerica and China and on the lower levels that will be true; but at\\nthe Cult level they are branches of the same company in the way of\\nthe McDonald’s example I gave earlier. I have tracked in the books\\nover the years support by US governments of both parties for\\nChinese Communist Party inﬁltration of American society through\\nallowing the sale of land, even military facilities, and the acquisition\\nof American business and university inﬂuence. All this is\\nunderpinned by the infamous stealing of intellectual property and\\ntechnological know-how. Cult-owned Silicon Valley corporations\\nwaive their fraudulent ‘morality’ to do business with human-rights-\\nfree China; Cult-controlled Disney has become China’s PR\\ndepartment; and China in eﬀect owns ‘American’ sports such as\\nbasketball which depends for much of its income on Chinese\\naudiences. As a result any sports player, coach or oﬃcial speaking\\nout against China’s horriﬁc human rights record is immediately\\ncondemned or ﬁred by the China-worshipping National Basketball\\nAssociation. One of the ﬁrst acts of China-controlled Biden was to\\nissue an executive order telling federal agencies to stop making\\nreferences to the ‘virus’ by the ‘geographic location of its origin’.\\nLong-time Congressman Jerry Nadler warned that criticising China,\\nAmerica’s biggest rival, leads to hate crimes against Asian people in\\nthe United States. So shut up you bigot. China is fast closing in on\\nIsrael as a country that must not be criticised which is apt, really,\\ngiven that Sabbatians control them both. The two countries have developed close economic, military, technological and strategic ties\\nwhich include involvement in China’s ‘Silk Road’ transport and\\neconomic initiative to connect China with Europe. Israel was the ﬁrst\\ncountry in the Middle East to recognise the establishment of Mao’s\\ntyranny in 1950 months a\\x00er it was established.\\nProject Wuhan – the ‘Covid’ Psyop\\nI emphasise again that the Cult plays the long game and what is\\nhappening to the world today is the result of centuries of calculated\\nmanipulation following a script to take control step-by-step of every\\naspect of human society. I will discuss later the common force\\nbehind all this that has spanned those centuries and thousands of\\nyears if the truth be told. Instigating the Mao revolution in China in\\n1949 with a 2020 ‘pandemic’ in mind is not only how they work – the\\n71 years between them is really quite short by the Cult’s standards of\\nmanipulation preparation. The reason for the Cult’s Chinese\\nrevolution was to create a ﬁercely-controlled environment within\\nwhich an extreme structure for human control could be incubated to\\neventually be unleashed across the world. We have seen this happen\\nsince the ‘pandemic’ emerged from China with the Chinese control-\\nstructure founded on AI technology and tyrannical enforcement\\nsweep across the West. Until the moment when the Cult went for\\nbroke in the West and put its fascism on public display Western\\ngovernments had to pay some lip-service to freedom and democracy\\nto not alert too many people to the tyranny-in-the-making. Freedoms\\nwere more subtly eroded and power centralised with covert\\ngovernment structures put in place waiting for the arrival of 2020\\nwhen that smokescreen of ‘freedom’ could be dispensed with. The\\nWest was not able to move towards tyranny before 2020 anything\\nlike as fast as China which was created as a tyranny and had no\\nlimits on how fast it could construct the Cult’s blueprint for global\\ncontrol. When the time came to impose that structure on the world it\\nwas the same Cult-owned Chinese communist/fascist government\\nthat provided the excuse – the ‘Covid pandemic’. It was absolutely\\ncrucial to the Cult plan for the Chinese response to the ‘pandemic’ – draconian lockdowns of the entire population – to become the\\nblueprint that Western countries would follow to destroy the\\nlivelihoods and freedom of their people. This is why the Cult-\\nowned, Gates-owned, WHO Director-General Tedros said early on:\\nThe Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to\\ncontain the outbreak. China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response and it is\\nnot an exaggeration.\\nForbes magazine said of China: ‘… those measures protected untold\\nmillions from ge\\x00ing the disease’. The Rockefeller Foundation\\n‘epidemic scenario’ document in 2010 said ‘prophetically’:\\nHowever, a few countries did fare better – China in particular. The Chinese government’s\\nquick imposition and enforcement of mandatory quarantine for all citizens, as well as its\\ninstant and near-hermetic sealing off of all borders, saved millions of lives, stopping the spread\\nof the virus far earlier than in other countries and enabling a swifter post-pandemic recovery.\\nOnce again – spooky.\\nThe ﬁrst oﬃcial story was the ‘bat theory’ or rather the bat\\ndiversion. The source of the ‘virus outbreak’ we were told was a\\n‘‘wet market’ in Wuhan where bats and other animals are bought\\nand eaten in horriﬁcally unhygienic conditions. Then another story\\nemerged through the alternative media that the ‘virus’ had been\\nreleased on purpose or by accident from a BSL-4 (biosafety level 4)\\nlaboratory in Wuhan not far from the wet market. The lab was\\nreported to create and work with lethal concoctions and\\nbioweapons. Biosafety level 4 is the highest in the World Health\\nOrganization system of safety and containment. Renegade Minds are\\naware of what I call designer manipulation. The ideal for the Cult is\\nfor people to buy its prime narrative which in the opening salvoes of\\nthe ‘pandemic’ was the wet market story. It knows, however, that\\nthere is now a considerable worldwide alternative media of\\nresearchers sceptical of anything governments say and they are o\\x00en\\ngiven a version of events in a form they can perceive as credible\\nwhile misdirecting them from the real truth. In this case let them think that the conspiracy involved is a ‘bioweapon virus’ released\\nfrom the Wuhan lab to keep them from the real conspiracy – there is\\nno ‘virus’. The WHO’s current position on the source of the outbreak\\nat the time of writing appears to be: ‘We haven’t got a clue, mate.’\\nThis is a good position to maintain mystery and bewilderment. The\\ninner circle will know where the ‘virus’ came from – nowhere. The\\nbo\\x00om line was to ensure the public believed there was a ‘virus’ and\\nit didn’t much ma\\x00er if they thought it was natural or had been\\nreleased from a lab. The belief that there was a ‘deadly virus’ was all\\nthat was needed to trigger global panic and fear. The population was\\nterriﬁed into handing their power to authority and doing what they\\nwere told. They had to or they were ‘all gonna die’.\\nIn March, 2020, information began to come my way from real\\ndoctors and scientists and my own additional research which had\\nmy intuition screaming: ‘Yes, that’s it! There is no virus.’ The\\n‘bioweapon’ was not the ‘virus’; it was the ‘vaccine’ already being\\ntalked about that would be the bioweapon. My conclusion was\\nfurther enhanced by happenings in Wuhan. The ‘virus’ was said to\\nbe sweeping the city and news footage circulated of people\\ncollapsing in the street (which they’ve never done in the West with\\nthe same ‘virus’). The Chinese government was building ‘new\\nhospitals’ in a ma\\x00er of ten days to ‘cope with demand’ such was the\\nvirulent nature of the ‘virus’. Yet in what seemed like no time the\\n‘new hospitals’ closed – even if they even opened – and China\\ndeclared itself ‘virus-free’. It was back to business as usual. This was\\nmore propaganda to promote the Chinese draconian lockdowns in\\nthe West as the way to ‘beat the virus’. Trouble was that we\\nsubsequently had lockdown a\\x00er lockdown, but never business as\\nusual. As the people of the West and most of the rest of the world\\nwere caught in an ever-worsening spiral of lockdown, social\\ndistancing, masks, isolated old people, families forced apart, and\\nlivelihood destruction, it was party-time in Wuhan. Pictures\\nemerged of thousands of people enjoying pool parties and concerts.\\nIt made no sense until you realised there never was a ‘virus’ and the whole thing was a Cult set-up to transform human society out of one\\nits major global strongholds – China.\\nHow is it possible to deceive virtually the entire world population\\ninto believing there is a deadly virus when there is not even a ‘virus’\\nlet alone a deadly one? It’s nothing like as diﬃcult as you would\\nthink and that’s clearly true because it happened.\\nPostscript: See end of book Postscript for more on the ‘Wuhan lab\\nvirus release’ story which the authorities and media were pushing\\nheavily in the summer of 2021 to divert a\\x00ention from the truth that\\nthe ‘Covid virus’ is pure invention. T\\nCHAPTER FIVE\\nThere is no ‘virus’\\nYou can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people\\nsome of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time\\nAbraham Lincoln\\nhe greatest form of mind control is repetition. The more you\\nrepeat the same mantra of alleged ‘facts’ the more will accept\\nthem to be true. It becomes an ‘everyone knows that, mate’. If you\\ncan also censor any other version or alternative to your alleged\\n‘facts’ you are pre\\x00y much home and cooking.\\nBy the start of 2020 the Cult owned the global mainstream media\\nalmost in its entirety to spew out its ‘Covid’ propaganda and ignore\\nor discredit any other information and view. Cult-owned social\\nmedia platforms in Cult-owned Silicon Valley were poised and\\nready to unleash a campaign of ferocious censorship to obliterate all\\nbut the oﬃcial narrative. To complete the circle many demands for\\ncensorship by Silicon Valley were led by the mainstream media as\\n‘journalists’ became full-out enforcers for the Cult both as\\npropagandists and censors. Part of this has been the inﬂux of young\\npeople straight out of university who have become ‘journalists’ in\\nsigniﬁcant positions. They have no experience and a headful of\\nprogrammed perceptions from their years at school and university at\\na time when today’s young are the most perceptually-targeted\\ngenerations in known human history given the insidious impact of\\ntechnology. They enter the media perceptually prepared and ready\\nto repeat the narratives of the system that programmed them to repeat its narratives. The BBC has a truly pathetic ‘specialist\\ndisinformation reporter’ called Marianna Spring who ﬁts this bill\\nperfectly. She is clueless about the world, how it works and what is\\nreally going on. Her role is to discredit anyone doing the job that a\\nproper journalist would do and system-serving hacks like Spring\\nwouldn’t dare to do or even see the need to do. They are too busy\\nlicking the arse of authority which can never be wrong and, in the\\ncase of the BBC propaganda programme, Panorama, contacting\\npayments systems such as PayPal to have a donations page taken\\ndown for a ﬁlm company making documentaries questioning\\nvaccines. Even the BBC soap opera EastEnders included a\\ndisgracefully biased scene in which an inarticulate white working\\nclass woman was made to look foolish for questioning the ‘vaccine’\\nwhile a well-spoken black man and Asian woman promoted the\\ngovernment narrative. It ticked every BBC box and the fact that the\\nblack and minority community was resisting the ‘vaccine’ had\\nnothing to do with the way the scene was wri\\x00en. The BBC has\\nbecome a disgusting tyrannical propaganda and censorship\\noperation that should be defunded and disbanded and a free media\\ntake its place with a brief to stop censorship instead of demanding it.\\nA BBC ‘interview’ with Gates goes something like: ‘Mr Gates, sir, if I\\ncan call you sir, would you like to tell our audience why you are\\nsuch a great man, a wonderful humanitarian philanthropist, and\\nwhy you should absolutely be allowed as a so\\x00ware salesman to\\ndecide health policy for approaching eight billion people? Thank\\nyou, sir, please sir.’ Propaganda programming has been incessant\\nand merciless and when all you hear is the same story from the\\nmedia, repeated by those around you who have only heard the same\\nstory, is it any wonder that people on a grand scale believe absolute\\nmendacious garbage to be true? You are about to see, too, why this\\nlevel of information control is necessary when the oﬃcial ‘Covid’\\nnarrative is so nonsensical and unsupportable by the evidence.\\nStructure of Deceit The pyramid structure through which the ‘Covid’ hoax has been\\nmanifested is very simple and has to be to work. As few people as\\npossible have to be involved with full knowledge of what they are\\ndoing – and why – or the real story would get out. At the top of the\\npyramid are the inner core of the Cult which controls Bill Gates who,\\nin turn, controls the World Health Organization through his pivotal\\nfunding and his puppet Director-General mouthpiece, Tedros.\\nBefore he was appointed Tedros was chair of the Gates-founded\\nGlobal Fund to ‘ﬁght against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria’, a\\nboard member of the Gates-funded ‘vaccine alliance’ GAVI, and on\\nthe board of another Gates-funded organisation. Gates owns him\\nand picked him for a speciﬁc reason – Tedros is a crook and worse.\\n‘Dr’ Tedros (he’s not a medical doctor, the ﬁrst WHO chief not to be)\\nwas a member of the tyrannical Marxist government of Ethiopia for\\ndecades with all its human rights abuses. He has faced allegations of\\ncorruption and misappropriation of funds and was exposed three\\ntimes for covering up cholera epidemics while Ethiopia’s health\\nminister. Tedros appointed the mass-murdering genocidal\\nZimbabwe dictator Robert Mugabe as a WHO goodwill ambassador\\nfor public health which, as with Tedros, is like appointing a\\npsychopath to run a peace and love campaign. The move was so\\nridiculous that he had to drop Mugabe in the face of widespread\\ncondemnation. American economist David Steinman, a Nobel peace\\nprize nominee, lodged a complaint with the International Criminal\\nCourt in The Hague over alleged genocide by Tedros when he was\\nEthiopia’s foreign minister. Steinman says Tedros was a ‘crucial\\ndecision maker’ who directed the actions of Ethiopia’s security forces\\nfrom 2013 to 2015 and one of three oﬃcials in charge when those\\nsecurity services embarked on the ‘killing’ and ‘torturing’ of\\nEthiopians. You can see where Tedros is coming from and it’s\\nsobering to think that he has been the vehicle for Gates and the Cult\\nto direct the global response to ‘Covid’. Think about that. A\\npsychopathic Cult dictates to psychopath Gates who dictates to\\npsychopath Tedros who dictates how countries of the world must\\nrespond to a ‘Covid virus’ never scientiﬁcally shown to exist. At the\\nsame time psychopathic Cult-owned Silicon Valley information giants like Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twi\\x00er announced very\\nearly on that they would give the Cult/Gates/Tedros/WHO version\\nof the narrative free advertising and censor those who challenged\\ntheir intelligence-insulting, mendacious story.\\nThe next layer in the global ‘medical’ structure below the Cult,\\nGates and Tedros are the chief medical oﬃcers and science ‘advisers’\\nin each of the WHO member countries which means virtually all of\\nthem. Medical oﬃcers and arbiters of science (they’re not) then take\\nthe WHO policy and recommended responses and impose them on\\ntheir country’s population while the political ‘leaders’ say they are\\ndeciding policy (they’re clearly not) by ‘following the science’ on the\\nadvice of the ‘experts’ – the same medical oﬃcers and science\\n‘advisers’ (dictators). In this way with the rarest of exceptions the\\nentire world followed the same policy of lockdown, people\\ndistancing, masks and ‘vaccines’ dictated by the psychopathic Cult,\\npsychopathic Gates and psychopathic Tedros who we are supposed\\nto believe give a damn about the health of the world population they\\nare seeking to enslave. That, amazingly, is all there is to it in terms of\\ncrucial decision-making. Medical staﬀ in each country then follow\\nlike sheep the dictates of the shepherds at the top of the national\\nmedical hierarchies – chief medical oﬃcers and science ‘advisers’\\nwho themselves follow like sheep the shepherds of the World Health\\nOrganization and the Cult. Shepherds at the national level o\\x00en\\nhave major funding and other connections to Gates and his Bill and\\nMelinda Gates Foundation which carefully hands out money like\\nconfe\\x00i at a wedding to control the entire global medical system\\nfrom the WHO down.\\nFollow the money\\nChristopher Whi\\x00y, Chief Medical Adviser to the UK Government at\\nthe centre of ‘virus’ policy, a senior adviser to the government’s\\nScientiﬁc Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), and Executive\\nBoard member of the World Health Organization, was gi\\x00ed a grant\\nof $40 million by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for malaria\\nresearch in Africa. The BBC described the unelected Whi\\x00y as ‘the oﬃcial who will probably have the greatest impact on our everyday\\nlives of any individual policymaker in modern times’ and so it\\nturned out. What Gates and Tedros have said Whi\\x00y has done like\\nhis equivalents around the world. Patrick Vallance, co-chair of SAGE\\nand the government’s Chief Scientiﬁc Adviser, is a former executive\\nof Big Pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline with its fundamental ﬁnancial\\nand business connections to Bill Gates. In September, 2020, it was\\nrevealed that Vallance owned a deferred bonus of shares in\\nGlaxoSmithKline worth £600,000 while the company was\\n‘developing’ a ‘Covid vaccine’. Move along now – nothing to see\\nhere – what could possibly be wrong with that? Imperial College in\\nLondon, a major player in ‘Covid’ policy in Britain and elsewhere\\nwith its ‘Covid-19’ Response Team, is funded by Gates and has big\\nconnections to China while the now infamous Professor Neil\\nFerguson, the useless ‘computer modeller’ at Imperial College is also\\nfunded by Gates. Ferguson delivered the dramatically inaccurate\\nexcuse for the ﬁrst lockdowns (much more in the next chapter). The\\nInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in the United\\nStates, another source of outrageously false ‘Covid’ computer\\nmodels to justify lockdowns, is bankrolled by Gates who is a\\nvehement promotor of lockdowns. America’s version of Whi\\x00y and\\nVallance, the again now infamous Anthony Fauci, has connections to\\n‘Covid vaccine’ maker Moderna as does Bill Gates through funding\\nfrom the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Fauci is director of the\\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a\\nmajor recipient of Gates money, and they are very close. Deborah\\nBirx who was appointed White House Coronavirus Response\\nCoordinator in February, 2020, is yet another with ties to Gates.\\nEverywhere you look at the diﬀerent elements around the world\\nbehind the coordination and decision making of the ‘Covid’ hoax\\nthere is Bill Gates and his money. They include the World Health\\nOrganization; Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United\\nStates; National Institutes of Health (NIH) of Anthony Fauci;\\nImperial College and Neil Ferguson; the London School of Hygiene\\nwhere Chris Whi\\x00y worked; Regulatory agencies like the UK\\nMedicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) which gave emergency approval for ‘Covid vaccines’; Wellcome\\nTrust; GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance; the Coalition for Epidemic\\nPreparedness Innovations (CEPI); Johns Hopkins University which\\nhas compiled the false ‘Covid’ ﬁgures; and the World Economic\\nForum. A Nationalﬁle.com article said:\\nGates has a lot of pull in the medical world, he has a multi-million dollar relationship with Dr.\\nFauci, and Fauci originally took the Gates line supporting vaccines and casting doubt on [the\\ndrug hydroxychloroquine]. Coronavirus response team member Dr. Deborah Birx, appointed\\nby former president Obama to serve as United States Global AIDS Coordinator, also sits on the\\nboard of a group that has received billions from Gates’ foundation, and Birx reportedly used a\\ndisputed Bill Gates-funded model for the White House’s Coronavirus effort. Gates is a big\\nproponent for a population lockdown scenario for the Coronavirus outbreak.\\nAnother funder of Moderna is the Defense Advanced Research\\nProjects Agency (DARPA), the technology-development arm of the\\nPentagon and one of the most sinister organisations on earth.\\nDARPA had a major role with the CIA covert technology-funding\\noperation In-Q-Tel in the development of Google and social media\\nwhich is now at the centre of global censorship. Fauci and Gates are\\nextremely close and openly admit to talking regularly about ‘Covid’\\npolicy, but then why wouldn’t Gates have a seat at every national\\n‘Covid’ table a\\x00er his Foundation commi\\x00ed $1.75 billion to the\\n‘ﬁght against Covid-19’. When passed through our Orwellian\\nTranslation Unit this means that he has bought and paid for the Cult-\\ndriven ‘Covid’ response worldwide. Research the major ‘Covid’\\nresponse personnel in your own country and you will ﬁnd the same\\nGates funding and other connections again and again. Medical and\\nscience chiefs following World Health Organization ‘policy’ sit atop\\na medical hierarchy in their country of administrators, doctors and\\nnursing staﬀ. These ‘subordinates’ are told they must work and\\nbehave in accordance with the policy delivered from the ‘top’ of the\\nnational ‘health’ pyramid which is largely the policy delivered by\\nthe WHO which is the policy delivered by Gates and the Cult. The\\nwhole ‘Covid’ narrative has been imposed on medical staﬀ by a\\nclimate of fear although great numbers don’t even need that to\\ncomply. They do so through breathtaking levels of ignorance and include doctors who go through life simply repeating what Big\\nPharma and their hierarchical masters tell them to say and believe.\\nNo wonder Big Pharma ‘medicine’ is one of the biggest killers on\\nPlanet Earth.\\nThe same top-down system of intimidation operates with regard\\nto the Cult Big Pharma cartel which also dictates policy through\\nnational and global medical systems in this way. The Cult and Big\\nPharma agendas are the same because the former controls and owns\\nthe la\\x00er. ‘Health’ administrators, doctors, and nursing staﬀ are told\\nto support and parrot the dictated policy or they will face\\nconsequences which can include being ﬁred. How sad it’s been to see\\nmedical staﬀ meekly repeating and imposing Cult policy without\\nquestion and most of those who can see through the deceit are only\\nwilling to speak anonymously oﬀ the record. They know what will\\nhappen if their identity is known. This has le\\x00 the courageous few to\\nexpose the lies about the ‘virus’, face masks, overwhelmed hospitals\\nthat aren’t, and the dangers of the ‘vaccine’ that isn’t a vaccine. When\\nthese medical professionals and scientists, some renowned in their\\nﬁeld, have taken to the Internet to expose the truth their articles,\\ncomments and videos have been deleted by Cult-owned Facebook,\\nTwi\\x00er and YouTube. What a real head-shaker to see YouTube\\nvideos with leading world scientists and highly qualiﬁed medical\\nspecialists with an added link underneath to the notorious Cult\\npropaganda website Wikipedia to ﬁnd the ‘facts’ about the same\\nsubject.\\nHIV – the ‘Covid’ trial-run\\nI’ll give you an example of the consequences for health and truth\\nthat come from censorship and unquestioning belief in oﬃcial\\nnarratives. The story was told by PCR inventor Kary Mullis in his\\nbook Dancing Naked in the Mind Field. He said that in 1984 he\\naccepted as just another scientiﬁc fact that Luc Montagnier of\\nFrance’s Pasteur Institute and Robert Gallo of America’s National\\nInstitutes of Health had independently discovered that a ‘retrovirus’\\ndubbed HIV (human immunodeﬁciency virus) caused AIDS. They were, a\\x00er all, Mullis writes, specialists in retroviruses. This is how\\nthe medical and science pyramids work. Something is announced or\\nassumed and then becomes an everybody-knows-that purely through\\nrepetition of the assumption as if it is fact. Complete crap becomes\\naccepted truth with no supporting evidence and only repetition of\\nthe crap. This is how a ‘virus’ that doesn’t exist became the ‘virus’\\nthat changed the world. The HIV-AIDS fairy story became a multi-\\nbillion pound industry and the media poured out propaganda\\nterrifying the world about the deadly HIV ‘virus’ that caused the\\nlethal AIDS. By then Mullis was working at a lab in Santa Monica,\\nCalifornia, to detect retroviruses with his PCR test in blood\\ndonations received by the Red Cross. In doing so he asked a\\nvirologist where he could ﬁnd a reference for HIV being the cause of\\nAIDS. ‘You don’t need a reference,’ the virologist said … ‘Everybody\\nknows it.’ Mullis said he wanted to quote a reference in the report he\\nwas doing and he said he felt a li\\x00le funny about not knowing the\\nsource of such an important discovery when everyone else seemed\\nto. The virologist suggested he cite a report by the Centers for\\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) on morbidity and mortality.\\nMullis read the report, but it only said that an organism had been\\nidentiﬁed and did not say how. The report did not identify the\\noriginal scientiﬁc work. Physicians, however, assumed (key recurring\\ntheme) that if the CDC was convinced that HIV caused AIDS then\\nproof must exist. Mullis continues:\\nI did computer searches. Neither Montagnier, Gallo, nor anyone else had published papers\\ndescribing experiments which led to the conclusion that HIV probably caused AIDS. I read\\nthe papers in Science for which they had become well known as AIDS doctors, but all they\\nhad said there was that they had found evidence of a past infection by something which was\\nprobably HIV in some AIDS patients.\\nThey found antibodies. Antibodies to viruses had always been considered evidence of past\\ndisease, not present disease. Antibodies signaled that the virus had been defeated. The patient\\nhad saved himself. There was no indication in these papers that this virus caused a disease.\\nThey didn’t show that everybody with the antibodies had the disease. In fact they found some\\nhealthy people with antibodies. Mullis asked why their work had been published if Montagnier\\nand Gallo hadn’t really found this evidence, and why had they been\\nﬁghting so hard to get credit for the discovery? He says he was\\nhesitant to write ‘HIV is the probable cause of AIDS’ until he found\\npublished evidence to support that. ‘Tens of thousands of scientists\\nand researchers were spending billions of dollars a year doing\\nresearch based on this idea,’ Mullis writes. ‘The reason had to be\\nthere somewhere; otherwise these people would not have allowed\\ntheir research to se\\x00le into one narrow channel of investigation.’ He\\nsaid he lectured about PCR at numerous meetings where people\\nwere always talking about HIV and he asked them how they knew\\nthat HIV was the cause of AIDS:\\nEveryone said something. Everyone had the answer at home, in the office, in some drawer.\\nThey all knew, and they would send me the papers as soon as they got back. But I never got\\nany papers. Nobody ever sent me the news about how AIDS was caused by HIV.\\nEventually Mullis was able to ask Montagnier himself about the\\nreference proof when he lectured in San Diego at the grand opening\\nof the University of California AIDS Research Center. Mullis says\\nthis was the last time he would ask his question without showing\\nanger. Montagnier said he should reference the CDC report. ‘I read\\nit’, Mullis said, and it didn’t answer the question. ‘If Montagnier\\ndidn’t know the answer who the hell did?’ Then one night Mullis\\nwas driving when an interview came on National Public Radio with\\nPeter Duesberg, a prominent virologist at Berkeley and a California\\nScientist of the Year. Mullis says he ﬁnally understood why he could\\nnot ﬁnd references that connected HIV to AIDS – there weren’t any!\\nNo one had ever proved that HIV causes AIDS even though it had\\nspawned a multi-billion pound global industry and the media was\\nrepeating this as fact every day in their articles and broadcasts\\nterrifying the shit out of people about AIDS and giving the\\nimpression that a positive test for HIV (see ‘Covid’) was a death\\nsentence. Duesberg was a threat to the AIDS gravy train and the\\nagenda that underpinned it. He was therefore abused and castigated\\na\\x00er he told the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences there was no good evidence implicating the new ‘virus’. Editors\\nrejected his manuscripts and his research funds were deleted. Mullis\\npoints out that the CDC has deﬁned AIDS as one of more than 30\\ndiseases if accompanied by a positive result on a test that detects\\nantibodies to HIV; but those same diseases are not deﬁned as AIDS\\ncases when antibodies are not detected:\\nIf an HIV-positive woman develops uterine cancer, for example, she is considered to have\\nAIDS. If she is not HIV positive, she simply has uterine cancer. An HIV-positive man with\\ntuberculosis has AIDS; if he tests negative he simply has tuberculosis. If he lives in Kenya or\\nColombia, where the test for HIV antibodies is too expensive, he is simply presumed to have\\nthe antibodies and therefore AIDS, and therefore he can be treated in the World Health\\nOrganization’s clinic. It’s the only medical help available in some places. And it’s free,\\nbecause the countries that support WHO are worried about AIDS.\\nMullis accuses the CDC of continually adding new diseases (see ever\\nmore ‘Covid symptoms’) to the grand AIDS deﬁnition and of\\nvirtually doctoring the books to make it appear as if the disease\\ncontinued to spread. He cites how in 1993 the CDC enormously\\nbroadened its AIDS deﬁnition and county health authorities were\\ndelighted because they received $2,500 per year from the Federal\\ngovernment for every reported AIDS case. Ladies and gentlemen, I\\nhave just described, via Kary Mullis, the ‘Covid pandemic’ of 2020\\nand beyond. Every element is the same and it’s been pulled oﬀ in the\\nsame way by the same networks.\\nThe ‘Covid virus’ exists? Okay – prove it. Er … still waiting\\nWhat Kary Mullis described with regard to ‘HIV’ has been repeated\\nwith ‘Covid’. A claim is made that a new, or ‘novel’, infection has\\nbeen found and the entire medical system of the world repeats that\\nas fact exactly as they did with HIV and AIDS. No one in the\\nmainstream asks rather relevant questions such as ‘How do you\\nknow?’ and ‘Where is your proof?’ The SARS-Cov-2 ‘virus’ and the\\n‘Covid-19 disease’ became an overnight ‘everybody-knows-that’.\\nThe origin could be debated and mulled over, but what you could\\nnot suggest was that ‘SARS-Cov-2’ didn’t exist. That would be ridiculous. ‘Everybody knows’ the ‘virus’ exists. Well, I didn’t for\\none along with American proper doctors like Andrew Kaufman and\\nTom Cowan and long-time American proper journalist Jon\\nRappaport. We dared to pursue the obvious and simple question:\\n‘Where’s the evidence?’ The overwhelming majority in medicine,\\njournalism and the general public did not think to ask that. A\\x00er all,\\neveryone knew there was a new ‘virus’. Everyone was saying so and I\\nheard it on the BBC. Some would eventually argue that the ‘deadly\\nvirus’ was nothing like as deadly as claimed, but few would venture\\ninto the realms of its very existence. Had they done so they would\\nhave found that the evidence for that claim had gone AWOL as with\\nHIV causes AIDS. In fact, not even that. For something to go AWOL\\nit has to exist in the ﬁrst place and scientiﬁc proof for a ‘SARS-Cov-2’\\ncan be ﬁled under nothing, nowhere and zilch.\\nDr Andrew Kaufman is a board-certiﬁed forensic psychiatrist in\\nNew York State, a Doctor of Medicine and former Assistant\\nProfessor and Medical Director of Psychiatry at SUNY Upstate\\nMedical University, and Medical Instructor of Hematology and\\nOncology at the Medical School of South Carolina. He also studied\\nbiology at the Massachuse\\x00s Institute of Technology (MIT) and\\ntrained in Psychiatry at Duke University. Kaufman is retired from\\nallopathic medicine, but remains a consultant and educator on\\nnatural healing, I saw a video of his very early on in the ‘Covid’ hoax\\nin which he questioned claims about the ‘virus’ in the absence of any\\nsupporting evidence and with plenty pointing the other way. I did\\neverything I could to circulate his work which I felt was asking the\\npivotal questions that needed an answer. I can recommend an\\nexcellent pull-together interview he did with the website The Last\\nVagabond entitled Dr Andrew Kaufman: Virus Isolation, Terrain Theory\\nand Covid-19 and his website is andrewkaufmanmd.com. Kaufman is\\nnot only a forensic psychiatrist; he is forensic in all that he does. He\\nalways reads original scientiﬁc papers, experiments and studies\\ninstead of second-third-fourth-hand reports about the ‘virus’ in the\\nmedia which are repeating the repeated repetition of the narrative.\\nWhen he did so with the original Chinese ‘virus’ papers Kaufman realised that there was no evidence of a ‘SARS-Cov-2’. They had\\nnever – from the start – shown it to exist and every repeat of this\\nclaim worldwide was based on the accepted existence of proof that\\nwas nowhere to be found – see Kary Mullis and HIV. Here we go\\nagain.\\nLet’s postulate\\nKaufman discovered that the Chinese authorities immediately\\nconcluded that the cause of an illness that broke out among about\\n200 initial patients in Wuhan was a ‘new virus’ when there were no\\ngrounds to make that conclusion. The alleged ‘virus’ was not\\nisolated from other genetic material in their samples and then shown\\nthrough a system known as Koch’s postulates to be the causative\\nagent of the illness. The world was told that the SARS-Cov-2 ‘virus’\\ncaused a disease they called ‘Covid-19’ which had ‘ﬂu-like’\\nsymptoms and could lead to respiratory problems and pneumonia.\\nIf it wasn’t so tragic it would almost be funny. ‘Flu-like’ symptoms’?\\nPneumonia? Respiratory disease? What in CHINA and particularly in\\nWuhan, one of the most polluted cities in the world with a resulting\\nepidemic of respiratory disease?? Three hundred thousand people\\nget pneumonia in China every year and there are nearly a billion\\ncases worldwide of ‘ﬂu-like symptoms’. These have a whole range of\\ncauses – including pollution in Wuhan – but no other possibility was\\ncredibly considered in late 2019 when the world was told there was a\\nnew and deadly ‘virus’. The global prevalence of pneumonia and\\n‘ﬂu-like systems’ gave the Cult networks unlimited potential to re-\\ndiagnose these other causes as the mythical ‘Covid-19’ and that is\\nwhat they did from the very start. Kaufman revealed how Chinese\\nmedical and science authorities (all subordinates to the Cult-owned\\ncommunist government) took genetic material from the lungs of\\nonly a few of the ﬁrst patients. The material contained their own\\ncells, bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms living in their bodies.\\nThe only way you could prove the existence of the ‘virus’ and its\\nresponsibility for the alleged ‘Covid-19’ was to isolate the virus from\\nall the other material – a process also known as ‘puriﬁcation’ – and then follow the postulates sequence developed in the late 19th\\ncentury by German physician and bacteriologist Robert Koch which\\nbecame the ‘gold standard’ for connecting an alleged causation\\nagent to a disease:\\n1. The microorganism (bacteria, fungus, virus, etc.) must be present in every case of the\\ndisease and all patients must have the same symptoms. It must also not be present in healthy\\nindividuals.\\n2. The microorganism must be isolated from the host with the disease. If the microorganism\\nis a bacteria or fungus it must be grown in a pure culture. If it is a virus, it must be puriﬁed\\n(i.e. containing no other material except the virus particles) from a clinical sample.\\n3. The speciﬁc disease, with all of its characteristics, must be reproduced when the\\ninfectious agent (the puriﬁed virus or a pure culture of bacteria or fungi) is inoculated into a\\nhealthy, susceptible host.\\n4. The microorganism must be recoverable from the experimentally infected host as in step\\n2.\\nNot one of these criteria has been met in the case of ‘SARS-Cov-2’ and\\n‘Covid-19’. Not ONE. EVER. Robert Koch refers to bacteria and not\\nviruses. What are called ‘viral particles’ are so minute (hence masks\\nare useless by any deﬁnition) that they could only be seen a\\x00er the\\ninvention of the electron microscope in the 1930s and can still only\\nbe observed through that means. American bacteriologist and\\nvirologist Thomas Milton Rivers, the so-called ‘Father of Modern\\nVirology’ who was very signiﬁcantly director of the Rockefeller\\nInstitute for Medical Research in the 1930s, developed a less\\nstringent version of Koch’s postulates to identify ‘virus’ causation\\nknown as ‘Rivers criteria’. ‘Covid’ did not pass that process either.\\nSome even doubt whether any ‘virus’ can be isolated from other\\nparticles containing genetic material in the Koch method. Freedom\\nof Information requests in many countries asking for scientiﬁc proof\\nthat the ‘Covid virus’ has been puriﬁed and isolated and shown to\\nexist have all come back with a ‘we don’t have that’ and when this\\nhappened with a request to the UK Department of Health they\\nadded this comment: However, outside of the scope of the [Freedom of Information Act] and on a discretionary\\nbasis, the following information has been advised to us, which may be of interest. Most\\ninfectious diseases are caused by viruses, bacteria or fungi. Some bacteria or fungi have the\\ncapacity to grow on their own in isolation, for example in colonies on a petri dish. Viruses are\\ndifferent in that they are what we call ‘obligate pathogens’ – that is, they cannot survive or\\nreproduce without infecting a host ...\\n… For some diseases, it is possible to establish causation between a microorganism and a\\ndisease by isolating the pathogen from a patient, growing it in pure culture and reintroducing\\nit to a healthy organism. These are known as ‘Koch’s postulates’ and were developed in 1882.\\nHowever, as our understanding of disease and different disease-causing agents has advanced,\\nthese are no longer the method for determining causation [Andrew Kaufman asks why in that\\ncase are there two published articles falsely claiming to satisfy Koch’s postulates].\\nIt has long been known that viral diseases cannot be identified in this way as viruses cannot\\nbe grown in ‘pure culture’. When a patient is tested for a viral illness, this is normally done by\\nlooking for the presence of antigens, or viral genetic code in a host with molecular biology\\ntechniques [Kaufman asks how you could know the origin of these chemicals without having\\na pure culture for comparison].\\nFor the record ‘antigens’ are deﬁned so:\\nInvading microorganisms have antigens on their surface that the human body can recognise as\\nbeing foreign – meaning not belonging to it. When the body recognises a foreign antigen,\\nlymphocytes (white blood cells) produce antibodies, which are complementary in shape to\\nthe antigen.\\nNotwithstanding that this is open to question in relation to ‘SARS-\\nCov-2’ the presence of ‘antibodies’ can have many causes and they\\nare found in people that are perfectly well. Kary Mullis said:\\n‘Antibodies … had always been considered evidence of past disease,\\nnot present disease.’\\n‘Covid’ really is a computer ‘virus’\\nWhere the UK Department of Health statement says ‘viruses’ are\\nnow ‘diagnosed’ through a ‘viral genetic code in a host with\\nmolecular biology techniques’, they mean … the PCR test which its\\ninventor said cannot test for infectious disease. They have no\\ncredible method of connecting a ‘virus’ to a disease and we will see\\nthat there is no scientiﬁc proof that any ‘virus’ causes any disease or\\nthere is any such thing as a ‘virus’ in the way that it is described.\\nTenacious Canadian researcher Christine Massey and her team made some 40 Freedom of Information requests to national public health\\nagencies in diﬀerent countries asking for proof that SARS-CoV-2 has\\nbeen isolated and not one of them could supply that information.\\nMassey said of her request in Canada: ‘Freedom of Information\\nreveals Public Health Agency of Canada has no record of ‘SARS-\\nCOV-2’ isolation performed by anyone, anywhere, ever.’ If you\\naccept the comment from the UK Department of Health it’s because\\nthey can’t isolate a ‘virus’. Even so many ‘science’ papers claimed to\\nhave isolated the ‘Covid virus’ until they were questioned and had\\nto admit they hadn’t. A reply from the Robert Koch Institute in\\nGermany was typical: ‘I am not aware of a paper which puriﬁed\\nisolated SARS-CoV-2.’ So what the hell was Christian Drosten and\\nhis gang using to design the ‘Covid’ testing protocol that has\\nproduced all the illusory Covid’ cases and ‘Covid’ deaths when the\\nhead of the Chinese version of the CDC admi\\x00ed there was a\\nproblem right from the start in that the ‘virus’ had never been\\nisolated/puriﬁed? Breathe deeply: What they are calling ‘Covid’ is\\nactually created by a computer program i.e. they made it up – er, that’s\\nit. They took lung ﬂuid, with many sources of genetic material, from\\none single person alleged to be infected with Covid-19 by a PCR test\\nwhich they claimed, without clear evidence, contained a ‘virus’. They\\nused several computer programs to create a model of a theoretical\\nvirus genome sequence from more than ﬁ\\x00y-six million small\\nsequences of RNA, each of an unknown source, assembling them\\nlike a puzzle with no known solution. The computer ﬁlled in the\\ngaps with sequences from bits in the gene bank to make it look like a\\nbat SARS-like coronavirus! A wave of the magic wand and poof, an\\nin silico (computer-generated) genome, a scientiﬁc fantasy, was\\ncreated. UK health researcher Dr Kevin Corbe\\x00 made the same point\\nwith this analogy:\\n… It’s like giving you a few bones and saying that’s your fish. It could be any fish. Not even a\\nskeleton. Here’s a few fragments of bones. That’s your fish … It’s all from gene bank and the\\nbits of the virus sequence that weren’t there they made up.\\nThey synthetically created them to fill in the blanks. That’s what genetics is; it’s a code. So it’s\\nABBBCCDDD and you’re missing some what you think is EEE so you put it in. It’s all synthetic. You just manufacture the bits that are missing. This is the end result of the\\ngeneticization of virology. This is basically a computer virus.\\nFurther conﬁrmation came in an email exchange between British\\ncitizen journalist Frances Leader and the government’s Medicines &\\nHealthcare Products Regulatory Agency (the Gates-funded MHRA)\\nwhich gave emergency permission for untested ‘Covid vaccines’ to\\nbe used. The agency admi\\x00ed that the ‘vaccine’ is not based on an\\nisolated ‘virus’, but comes from a computer-generated model. Frances\\nLeader was naturally banned from Cult-owned fascist Twi\\x00er for\\nmaking this exchange public. The process of creating computer-\\ngenerated alleged ‘viruses’ is called ‘in silico’ or ‘in silicon’ –\\ncomputer chips – and the term ‘in silico’ is believed to originate with\\nbiological experiments using only a computer in 1989. ‘Vaccines’\\ninvolved with ‘Covid’ are also produced ‘in silico’ or by computer\\nnot a natural process. If the original ‘virus’ is nothing more than a\\nmade-up computer model how can there be ‘new variants’ of\\nsomething that never existed in the ﬁrst place? They are not new\\n‘variants’; they are new computer models only minutely diﬀerent to\\nthe original program and designed to further terrify the population\\ninto having the ‘vaccine’ and submi\\x00ing to fascism. You want a ‘new\\nvariant’? Click, click, enter – there you go. Tell the medical\\nprofession that you have discovered a ‘South African variant’, ‘UK\\nvariants’ or a ‘Brazilian variant’ and in the usual HIV-causes-AIDS\\nmanner they will unquestioningly repeat it with no evidence\\nwhatsoever to support these claims. They will go on television and\\nwarn about the dangers of ‘new variants’ while doing nothing more\\nthan repeating what they have been told to be true and knowing that\\nany deviation from that would be career suicide. Big-time insiders\\nwill know it’s a hoax, but much of the medical community is clueless\\nabout the way they are being played and themselves play the public\\nwithout even being aware they are doing so. What an interesting\\n‘coincidence’ that AstraZeneca and Oxford University were\\nconducting ‘Covid vaccine trials’ in the three countries – the UK,\\nSouth Africa and Brazil – where the ﬁrst three ‘variants’ were\\nclaimed to have ‘broken out’. Here’s your ‘virus’ – it’s a unicorn\\nDr Andrew Kaufman presented a brilliant analysis describing how\\nthe ‘virus’ was imagined into fake existence when he dissected an\\narticle published by Nature and wri\\x00en by 19 authors detailing\\nalleged ‘sequencing of a complete viral genome’ of the ‘new SARS-\\nCoV-2 virus’. This computer-modelled in silico genome was used as a\\ntemplate for all subsequent genome sequencing experiments that\\nresulted in the so-called variants which he said now number more\\nthan 6,000. The fake genome was constructed from more than 56\\nmillion individual short strands of RNA. Those li\\x00le pieces were\\nassembled into longer pieces by ﬁnding areas of overlapping\\nsequences. The computer programs created over two million\\npossible combinations from which the authors simply chose the\\nlongest one. They then compared this to a ‘bat virus’ and the\\ncomputer ‘alignment’ rearranged the sequence and ﬁlled in the gaps!\\nThey called this computer-generated abomination the ‘complete\\ngenome’. Dr Tom Cowan, a fellow medical author and collaborator\\nwith Kaufman, said such computer-generation constitutes scientiﬁc\\nfraud and he makes this superb analogy:\\nHere is an equivalency: A group of researchers claim to have found a unicorn because they\\nfound a piece of a hoof, a hair from a tail, and a snippet of a horn. They then add that\\ninformation into a computer and program it to re-create the unicorn, and they then claim this\\ncomputer re-creation is the real unicorn. Of course, they had never actually seen a unicorn so\\ncould not possibly have examined its genetic makeup to compare their samples with the\\nactual unicorn’s hair, hooves and horn.\\nThe researchers claim they decided which is the real genome of SARS-CoV-2 by ‘consensus’,\\nsort of like a vote. Again, different computer programs will come up with different versions of\\nthe imaginary ‘unicorn’, so they come together as a group and decide which is the real\\nimaginary unicorn.\\nThis is how the ‘virus’ that has transformed the world was brought\\ninto fraudulent ‘existence’. Extraordinary, yes, but as the Nazis said\\nthe bigger the lie the more will believe it. Cowan, however, wasn’t\\nﬁnished and he went on to identify what he called the real\\nblockbuster in the paper. He quotes this section from a paper wri\\x00en by virologists and published by the CDC and then explains what it\\nmeans:\\nTherefore, we examined the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in several\\ncommon primate and human cell lines, including human adenocarcinoma cells (A549),\\nhuman liver cells (HUH 7.0), and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T). In addition to\\nVero E6 and Vero CCL81 cells. ... Each cell line was inoculated at high multiplicity of\\ninfection and examined 24h post-infection.\\nNo CPE was observed in any of the cell lines except in Vero cells, which grew to greater than\\n10 to the 7th power at 24 h post-infection. In contrast, HUH 7.0 and 293T showed only\\nmodest viral replication, and A549 cells were incompatible with SARS CoV-2 infection.\\nCowan explains that when virologists a\\x00empt to prove infection\\nthey have three possible ‘hosts’ or models on which they can test.\\nThe ﬁrst was humans. Exposure to humans was generally not done\\nfor ethical reasons and has never been done with SARS-CoV-2 or any\\ncoronavirus. The second possible host was animals. Cowan said that\\nforge\\x00ing for a moment that they never actually use puriﬁed virus\\nwhen exposing animals they do use solutions that they claim contain\\nthe virus. Exposure to animals has been done with SARS-CoV-2 in\\nan experiment involving mice and this is what they found: None of\\nthe wild (normal) mice got sick. In a group of genetically-modiﬁed\\nmice, a statistically insigniﬁcant number lost weight and had slightly\\nbristled fur, but they experienced nothing like the illness called\\n‘Covid-19’. Cowan said the third method – the one they mostly rely\\non – is to inoculate solutions they say contain the virus onto a variety\\nof tissue cultures. This process had never been shown to kill tissue\\nunless the sample material was starved of nutrients and poisoned as\\npart of the process. Yes, incredibly, in tissue experiments designed to\\nshow the ‘virus’ is responsible for killing the tissue they starve the\\ntissue of nutrients and add toxic drugs including antibiotics and they\\ndo not have control studies to see if it’s the starvation and poisoning\\nthat is degrading the tissue rather than the ‘virus’ they allege to be in\\nthere somewhere. You want me to pinch you? Yep, I understand.\\nTom Cowan said this about the whole nonsensical farce as he\\nexplains what that quote from the CDC paper really means: The shocking thing about the above quote is that using their own methods, the virologists\\nfound that solutions containing SARS-CoV-2 – even in high amounts – were NOT, I repeat\\nNOT, infective to any of the three human tissue cultures they tested. In plain English, this\\nmeans they proved, on their terms, that this ‘new coronavirus’ is not infectious to human\\nbeings. It is ONLY infective to monkey kidney cells, and only then when you add two potent\\ndrugs (gentamicin and amphotericin), known to be toxic to kidneys, to the mix.\\nMy friends, read this again and again. These virologists, published by the CDC, performed a\\nclear proof, on their terms, showing that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is harmless to human beings.\\nThat is the only possible conclusion, but, unfortunately, this result is not even mentioned in\\ntheir conclusion. They simply say they can provide virus stocks cultured only on monkey Vero\\ncells, thanks for coming.\\nCowan concluded: ‘If people really understood how this “science”\\nwas done, I would hope they would storm the gates and demand\\nhonesty, transparency and truth.’ Dr Michael Yeadon, former Vice\\nPresident and Chief Scientiﬁc Adviser at drug giant Pﬁzer has been a\\nvocal critic of the ‘Covid vaccine’ and its potential for multiple harm.\\nHe said in an interview in April, 2021, that ‘not one [vaccine] has the\\nvirus. He was asked why vaccines normally using a ‘dead’ version of\\na disease to activate the immune system were not used for ‘Covid’\\nand instead we had the synthetic methods of the ‘mRNA Covid\\nvaccine’. Yeadon said that to do the former ‘you’d have to have some\\nof [the virus] wouldn’t you?’ He added: ‘No-one’s got any –\\nseriously.’ Yeadon said that surely they couldn’t have fooled the\\nwhole world for a year without having a virus, ‘but oddly enough\\nask around – no one’s got it’. He didn’t know why with all the ‘great\\nlabs’ around the world that the virus had not been isolated – ‘Maybe\\nthey’ve been too busy running bad PCR tests and vaccines that\\npeople don’t need.’ What is today called ‘science’ is not ‘science’ at\\nall. Science is no longer what is, but whatever people can be\\nmanipulated to believe that it is. Real science has been hĳacked by the\\nCult to dispense and produce the ‘expert scientists’ and contentions\\nthat suit the agenda of the Cult. How big-time this has happened\\nwith the ‘Covid’ hoax which is entirely based on fake science\\ndelivered by fake ‘scientists’ and fake ‘doctors’. The human-caused\\nclimate change hoax is also entirely based on fake science delivered\\nby fake ‘scientists’ and fake ‘climate experts’. In both cases real scientists, climate experts and doctors have their views suppressed\\nand deleted by the Cult-owned science establishment, media and\\nSilicon Valley. This is the ‘science’ that politicians claim to be\\n‘following’ and a common denominator of ‘Covid’ and climate are\\nCult psychopaths Bill Gates and his mate Klaus Schwab at the Gates-\\nfunded World Economic Forum. But, don’t worry, it’s all just a\\ncoincidence and absolutely nothing to worry about. Zzzzzzzz.\\nWhat is a ‘virus’ REALLY?\\nDr Tom Cowan is one of many contesting the very existence of\\nviruses let alone that they cause disease. This is understandable\\nwhen there is no scientiﬁc evidence for a disease-causing ‘virus’.\\nGerman virologist Dr Stefan Lanka won a landmark case in 2017 in\\nthe German Supreme Court over his contention that there is no such\\nthing as a measles virus. He had oﬀered a big prize for anyone who\\ncould prove there is and Lanka won his case when someone sought\\nto claim the money. There is currently a prize of more than 225,000\\neuros on oﬀer from an Isolate Truth Fund for anyone who can prove\\nthe isolation of SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic substance. Lanka wrote\\nin an article headed ‘The Misconception Called Virus’ that scientists\\nthink a ‘virus’ is causing tissue to become diseased and degraded\\nwhen in fact it is the processes they are using which do that – not a\\n‘virus’. Lanka has done an important job in making this point clear\\nas Cowan did in his analysis of the CDC paper. Lanka says that all\\nclaims about viruses as disease-causing pathogens are wrong and\\nbased on ‘easily recognisable, understandable and veriﬁable\\nmisinterpretations.’ Scientists believed they were working with\\n‘viruses’ in their laboratories when they were really working with\\n‘typical particles of speciﬁc dying tissues or cells …’ Lanka said that\\nthe tissue decaying process claimed to be caused by a ‘virus’ still\\nhappens when no alleged ‘virus’ is involved. It’s the process that does\\nthe damage and not a ‘virus’. The genetic sample is deprived of\\nnutrients, removed from its energy supply through removal from\\nthe body and then doused in toxic antibiotics to remove any bacteria.\\nHe conﬁrms again that establishment scientists do not (pinch me) conduct control experiments to see if this is the case and if they did\\nthey would see the claims that ‘viruses’ are doing the damage is\\nnonsense. He adds that during the measles ‘virus’ court case he\\ncommissioned an independent laboratory to perform just such a\\ncontrol experiment and the result was that the tissues and cells died\\nin the exact same way as with alleged ‘infected’ material. This is\\nsupported by a gathering number of scientists, doctors and\\nresearchers who reject what is called ‘germ theory’ or the belief in\\nthe body being infected by contagious sources emi\\x00ed by other\\npeople. Researchers Dawn Lester and David Parker take the same\\nstance in their highly-detailed and sourced book What Really Makes\\nYou Ill – Why everything you thought you knew about disease is wrong\\nwhich was recommended to me by a number of medical\\nprofessionals genuinely seeking the truth. Lester and Parker say\\nthere is no provable scientiﬁc evidence to show that a ‘virus’ can be\\ntransmi\\x00ed between people or people and animals or animals and\\npeople:\\nThe definition also claims that viruses are the cause of many diseases, as if this has been\\ndefinitively proven. But this is not the case; there is no original scientific evidence that\\ndefinitively demonstrates that any virus is the cause of any disease. The burden of proof for\\nany theory lies with those who proposed it; but none of the existing documents provides\\n‘proof’ that supports the claim that ‘viruses’ are pathogens.\\nDr Tom Cowan employs one of his clever analogies to describe the\\nprocess by which a ‘virus’ is named as the culprit for a disease when\\nwhat is called a ‘virus’ is only material released by cells detoxing\\nthemselves from inﬁltration by chemical or radiation poisoning. The\\ntidal wave of technologically-generated radiation in the ‘smart’\\nmodern world plus all the toxic food and drink are causing this to\\nhappen more than ever. Deluded ‘scientists’ misread this as a\\ngathering impact of what they wrongly label ‘viruses’.\\nPaper can infect houses\\nCowan said in an article for davidicke.com – with his tongue only\\nmildly in his cheek – that he believed he had made a tremendous discovery that may revolutionise science. He had discovered that\\nsmall bits of paper are alive, ‘well alive-ish’, can ‘infect’ houses, and\\nthen reproduce themselves inside the house. The result was that this\\nexplosion of growth in the paper inside the house causes the house\\nto explode, blowing it to smithereens. His evidence for this new\\ntheory is that in the past months he had carefully examined many of\\nthe houses in his neighbourhood and found almost no scraps of\\npaper on the lawns and surrounds of the house. There was an\\noccasional stray label, but nothing more. Then he would return to\\nthese same houses a week or so later and with a few, not all of them,\\nparticularly the old and decrepit ones, he found to his shock and\\nsurprise they were li\\x00ered with stray bits of paper. He knew then\\nthat the paper had infected these houses, made copies of itself, and\\nblew up the house. A young boy on a bicycle at one of the sites told\\nhim he had seen a demolition crew using dynamite to explode the\\nhouse the previous week, but Cowan dismissed this as the idle\\nthoughts of silly boys because ‘I was on to something big’. He was\\non to how ‘scientists’ mistake genetic material in the detoxifying\\nprocess for something they call a ‘virus’. Cowan said of his house\\nand paper story:\\nIf this sounds crazy to you, it’s because it should. This scenario is obviously nuts. But consider\\nthis admittedly embellished, for effect, current viral theory that all scientists, medical doctors\\nand virologists currently believe.\\nHe takes the example of the ‘novel SARS-Cov2’ virus to prove the\\npoint. First they take someone with an undeﬁned illness called\\n‘Covid-19’ and don’t even a\\x00empt to ﬁnd any virus in their sputum.\\nNever mind the scientists still describe how this ‘virus’, which they\\nhave not located a\\x00aches to a cell receptor, injects its genetic\\nmaterial, in ‘Covid’s’ case, RNA, into the cell. The RNA once inserted\\nexploits the cell to reproduce itself and makes ‘thousands, nay\\nmillions, of copies of itself … Then it emerges victorious to claim its\\nnext victim’: If you were to look in the scientific literature for proof, actual scientific proof, that uniform\\nSARS-CoV2 viruses have been properly isolated from the sputum of a sick person, that actual\\nspike proteins could be seen protruding from the virus (which has not been found), you would\\nfind that such evidence doesn’t exist.\\nIf you go looking in the published scientific literature for actual pictures, proof, that these\\nspike proteins or any viral proteins are ever attached to any receptor embedded in any cell\\nmembrane, you would also find that no such evidence exists. If you were to look for a video\\nor documented evidence of the intact virus injecting its genetic material into the body of the\\ncell, reproducing itself and then emerging victorious by budding off the cell membrane, you\\nwould find that no such evidence exists.\\nThe closest thing you would find is electron micrograph pictures of cellular particles, possibly\\nattached to cell debris, both of which to be seen were stained by heavy metals, a process that\\ncompletely distorts their architecture within the living organism. This is like finding bits of\\npaper stuck to the blown-up bricks, thereby proving the paper emerged by taking pieces of the\\nbricks on its way out.\\nThe Enders baloney\\nCowan describes the ‘Covid’ story as being just as make-believe as\\nhis paper story and he charts back this fantasy to a Nobel Prize\\nwinner called John Enders (1897-1985), an American biomedical\\nscientist who has been dubbed ‘The Father of Modern Vaccines’.\\nEnders is claimed to have ‘discovered’ the process of the viral\\nculture which ‘proved’ that a ‘virus’ caused measles. Cowan\\nexplains how Enders did this ‘by using the EXACT same procedure\\nthat has been followed by every virologist to ﬁnd and characterize\\nevery new virus since 1954’. Enders took throat swabs from children\\nwith measles and immersed them in 2ml of milk. Penicillin (100u/ml)\\nand the antibiotic streptomycin (50,g/ml) were added and the whole\\nmix was centrifuged – rotated at high speed to separate large cellular\\ndebris from small particles and molecules as with milk and cream,\\nfor example. Cowan says that if the aim is to ﬁnd li\\x00le particles of\\ngenetic material (‘viruses’) in the snot from children with measles it\\nwould seem that the last thing you would do is mix the snot with\\nother material – milk –that also has genetic material. ‘How are you\\never going to know whether whatever you found came from the snot\\nor the milk?’ He points out that streptomycin is a ‘nephrotoxic’ or\\npoisonous-to-the-kidney drug. You will see the relevance of that shortly. Cowan says that it gets worse, much worse, when Enders\\ndescribes the culture medium upon which the virus ‘grows’: ‘The\\nculture medium consisted of bovine amniotic ﬂuid (90%), beef\\nembryo extract (5%), horse serum (5%), antibiotics and phenol red as\\nan indicator of cell metabolism.’ Cowan asks incredulously: ‘Did he\\njust say that the culture medium also contained ﬂuids and tissues\\nthat are themselves rich sources of genetic material?’ The genetic\\ncocktail, or ‘medium’, is inoculated onto tissue and cells from rhesus\\nmonkey kidney tissue. This is where the importance of streptomycin\\ncomes in and currently-used antimicrobials and other drugs that are\\npoisonous to kidneys and used in ALL modern viral cultures (e.g.\\ngentamicin, streptomycin, and amphotericin). Cowan asks: ‘How are\\nyou ever going to know from this witch’s brew where any genetic\\nmaterial comes from as we now have ﬁve diﬀerent sources of rich\\ngenetic material in our mix?’ Remember, he says, that all genetic\\nmaterial, whether from monkey kidney tissues, bovine serum, milk,\\netc., is made from the exact same components. The same central\\nquestion returns: ‘How are you possibly going to know that it was\\nthe virus that killed the kidney tissue and not the toxic antibiotic and\\nstarvation rations on which you are growing the tissue?’ John Enders\\nanswered the question himself – you can’t:\\nA second agent was obtained from an uninoculated culture of monkey kidney cells. The\\ncytopathic changes [death of the cells] it induced in the unstained preparations could not be\\ndistinguished with confidence from the viruses isolated from measles.\\nThe death of the cells (‘cytopathic changes’) happened in exactly\\nthe same manner, whether they inoculated the kidney tissue with the\\nmeasles snot or not, Cowan says. ‘This is evidence that the\\ndestruction of the tissue, the very proof of viral causation of illness,\\nwas not caused by anything in the snot because they saw the same\\ndestructive eﬀect when the snot was not even used … the cytopathic,\\ni.e., cell-killing, changes come from the process of the culture itself,\\nnot from any virus in any snot, period.’ Enders quotes in his 1957\\npaper a virologist called Ruckle as reporting similar ﬁndings ‘and in\\naddition has isolated an agent from monkey kidney tissue that is so far indistinguishable from human measles virus’. In other words,\\nCowan says, these particles called ‘measles viruses’ are simply and\\nclearly breakdown products of the starved and poisoned tissue. For\\nmeasles ‘virus’ see all ‘viruses’ including the so-called ‘Covid virus’.\\nEnders, the ‘Father of Modern Vaccines’, also said:\\nThere is a potential risk in employing cultures of primate cells for the production of vaccines\\ncomposed of attenuated virus, since the presence of other agents possibly latent in primate\\ntissues cannot be definitely excluded by any known method.\\nCowan further quotes from a paper published in the journal\\nViruses in May, 2020, while the ‘Covid pandemic’ was well\\nunderway in the media if not in reality. ‘EVs’ here refers to particles\\nof genetic debris from our own tissues, such as exosomes of which\\nmore in a moment: ‘The remarkable resemblance between EVs and\\nviruses has caused quite a few problems in the studies focused on\\nthe analysis of EVs released during viral infections.’ Later the paper\\nadds that to date a reliable method that can actually guarantee a\\ncomplete separation (of EVs from viruses) DOES NOT EXIST. This\\nwas published at a time when a fairy tale ‘virus’ was claimed in total\\ncertainty to be causing a fairy tale ‘viral disease’ called ‘Covid-19’ – a\\nfairy tale that was already well on the way to transforming human\\nsociety in the image that the Cult has worked to achieve for so long.\\nCowan concludes his article:\\nTo summarize, there is no scientific evidence that pathogenic viruses exist. What we think of\\nas ‘viruses’ are simply the normal breakdown products of dead and dying tissues and cells.\\nWhen we are well, we make fewer of these particles; when we are starved, poisoned,\\nsuffocated by wearing masks, or afraid, we make more.\\nThere is no engineered virus circulating and making people sick. People in laboratories all\\nover the world are making genetically modified products to make people sick. These are\\ncalled vaccines. There is no virome, no ‘ecosystem’ of viruses, viruses are not 8%, 50% or\\n100 % of our genetic material. These are all simply erroneous ideas based on the\\nmisconception called a virus.\\nWhat is ‘Covid’? Load of bollocks The background described here by Cowan and Lanka was\\nemphasised in the ﬁrst video presentation that I saw by Dr Andrew\\nKaufman when he asked whether the ‘Covid virus’ was in truth a\\nnatural defence mechanism of the body called ‘exosomes’. These are\\nreleased by cells when in states of toxicity – see the same themes\\nreturning over and over. They are released ever more profusely as\\nchemical and radiation toxicity increases and think of the potential\\neﬀect therefore of 5G alone as its destructive frequencies infest the\\nhuman energetic information ﬁeld with a gathering pace (5G went\\nonline in Wuhan in 2019 as the ‘virus’ emerged). I’ll have more about\\nthis later. Exosomes transmit a warning to the rest of the body that\\n‘Houston, we have a problem’. Kaufman presented images of\\nexosomes and compared them with ‘Covid’ under an electron\\nmicroscope and the similarity was remarkable. They both a\\x00ach to\\nthe same cell receptors (claimed in the case of ‘Covid’), contain the\\nsame genetic material in the form of RNA or ribonucleic acid, and\\nboth are found in ‘viral cell cultures’ with damaged or dying cells.\\nJames Hildreth MD, President and Chief Executive Oﬃcer of the\\nMeharry Medical College at Johns Hopkins, said: ‘The virus is fully\\nan exosome in every sense of the word.’ Kaufman’s conclusion was\\nthat there is no ‘virus’: ‘This entire pandemic is a completely\\nmanufactured crisis … there is no evidence of anyone dying from\\n[this] illness.’ Dr Tom Cowan and Sally Fallon Morell, authors of The\\nContagion Myth, published a statement with Dr Kaufman in\\nFebruary, 2021, explaining why the ‘virus’ does not exist and you can\\nread it that in full in the Appendix.\\n‘Virus’ theory can be traced to the ‘cell theory’ in 1858 of German\\nphysician Rudolf Virchow (1821-1920) who contended that disease\\noriginates from a single cell inﬁltrated by a ‘virus’. Dr Stefan Lanka\\nsaid that ﬁndings and insights with respect to the structure, function\\nand central importance of tissues in the creation of life, which were\\nalready known in 1858, comprehensively refute the cell theory.\\nVirchow ignored them. We have seen the part later played by John\\nEnders in the 1950s and Lanka notes that infection theories were\\nonly established as a global dogma through the policies and eugenics of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany (creation of the same\\nSabbatian cult behind the ‘Covid’ hoax). Lanka said: ‘Before 1933,\\nscientists dared to contradict this theory; a\\x00er 1933, these critical\\nscientists were silenced’. Dr Tom Cowan’s view is that ill-heath is\\ncaused by too much of something, too li\\x00le of something, or\\ntoxiﬁcation from chemicals and radiation – not contagion. We must\\nalso highlight as a major source of the ‘virus’ theology a man still\\ncalled the ‘Father of Modern Virology’ – Thomas Milton Rivers\\n(1888-1962). There is no way given the Cult’s long game policy that it\\nwas a coincidence for the ‘Father of Modern Virology’ to be director\\nof the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research from 1937 to 1956\\nwhen he is credited with making the Rockefeller Institute a leader in\\n‘viral research’. Cult Rockefellers were the force behind the creation\\nof Big Pharma ‘medicine’, established the World Health\\nOrganisation in 1948, and have long and close associations with the\\nGates family that now runs the WHO during the pandemic hoax\\nthrough mega-rich Cult gofer and psychopath Bill Gates.\\nOnly a Renegade Mind can see through all this bullshit by asking\\nthe questions that need to be answered, not taking ‘no’ or\\nprevarication for an answer, and certainly not hiding from the truth\\nin fear of speaking it. Renegade Minds have always changed the\\nworld for the be\\x00er and they will change this one no ma\\x00er how\\nbleak it may currently appear to be. A\\nCHAPTER SIX\\nSequence of deceit\\nIf you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything\\nMark Twain\\ngainst the background that I have laid out this far the sequence\\nthat took us from an invented ‘virus’ in Cult-owned China in\\nlate 2019 to the fascist transformation of human society can be seen\\nand understood in a whole new context.\\nWe were told that a deadly disease had broken out in Wuhan and\\nthe world media began its campaign (coordinated by behavioural\\npsychologists as we shall see) to terrify the population into\\nunquestioning compliance. We were shown images of Chinese\\npeople collapsing in the street which never happened in the West\\nwith what was supposed to be the same condition. In the earliest\\ndays when alleged cases and deaths were few the fear register was\\nhysterical in many areas of the media and this would expand into\\nthe common media narrative across the world. The real story was\\nrather diﬀerent, but we were never told that. The Chinese\\ngovernment, one of the Cult’s biggest centres of global operation,\\nsaid they had discovered a new illness with ﬂu-like and pneumonia-\\ntype symptoms in a city with such toxic air that it is overwhelmed\\nwith ﬂu-like symptoms, pneumonia and respiratory disease. Chinese\\nscientists said it was a new – ‘novel’ – coronavirus which they called\\nSars-Cov-2 and that it caused a disease they labelled ‘Covid-19’.\\nThere was no evidence for this and the ‘virus’ has never to this day\\nbeen isolated, puriﬁed and its genetic code established from that. It was from the beginning a computer-generated ﬁction. Stories of\\nChinese whistleblowers saying the number of deaths was being\\nsupressed or that the ‘new disease’ was related to the Wuhan bio-lab\\nmisdirected mainstream and alternative media into cul-de-sacs to\\nobscure the real truth – there was no ‘virus’.\\nChinese scientists took genetic material from the lung ﬂuid of just\\na few people and said they had found a ‘new’ disease when this\\nmaterial had a wide range of content. There was no evidence for a\\n‘virus’ for the very reasons explained in the last two chapters. The\\n‘virus’ has never been shown to (a) exist and (b) cause any disease.\\nPeople were diagnosed on symptoms that are so widespread in\\nWuhan and polluted China and with a PCR test that can’t detect\\ninfectious disease. On this farce the whole global scam was sold to\\nthe rest of the world which would also diagnose respiratory disease\\nas ‘Covid-19’ from symptoms alone or with a PCR test not testing for\\na ‘virus’. Flu miraculously disappeared worldwide in 2020 and into\\n2021 as it was redesignated ‘Covid-19’. It was really the same old ﬂu\\nwith its ‘ﬂu-like’ symptoms a\\x00ributed to ‘ﬂu-like’ ‘Covid-19’. At the\\nsame time with very few exceptions the Chinese response of\\ndraconian lockdown and fascism was the chosen weapon to respond\\nacross the West as recommended by the Cult-owned Tedros at the\\nCult-owned World Health Organization run by the Cult-owned\\nGates. All was going according to plan. Chinese scientists –\\neverything in China is controlled by the Cult-owned government –\\ncompared their contaminated RNA lung-ﬂuid material with other\\nRNA sequences and said it appeared to be just under 80 percent\\nidentical to the SARS-CoV-1 ‘virus’ claimed to be the cause of the\\nSARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) ‘outbreak’ in 2003. They\\ndecreed that because of this the ‘new virus’ had to be related and\\nthey called it SARS-CoV-2. There are some serious problems with\\nthis assumption and assumption was all it was. Most ‘factual’ science\\nturns out to be assumptions repeated into everyone-knows-that. A\\nmatch of under 80-percent is meaningless. Dr Kaufman makes the\\npoint that there’s a 96 percent genetic correlation between humans\\nand chimpanzees, but ‘no one would say our genetic material is part of the chimpanzee family’. Yet the Chinese authorities were claiming\\nthat a much lower percentage, less than 80 percent, proved the\\nexistence of a new ‘coronavirus’. For goodness sake human DNA is\\n60 percent similar to a banana.\\nYou are feeling sleepy\\nThe entire ‘Covid’ hoax is a global Psyop, a psychological operation\\nto program the human mind into believing and fearing a complete\\nfantasy. A crucial aspect of this was what appeared to happen in Italy.\\nIt was all very well streaming out daily images of an alleged\\ncatastrophe in Wuhan, but to the Western mind it was still on the\\nother side of the world in a very diﬀerent culture and se\\x00ing. A\\nreaction of ‘this could happen to me and my family’ was still nothing\\nlike as intense enough for the mind-doctors. The Cult needed a\\nWestern example to push people over that edge and it chose Italy,\\none of its major global locations going back to the Roman Empire.\\nAn Italian ‘Covid’ crisis was manufactured in a particular area called\\nLombardy which just happens to be notorious for its toxic air and\\ntherefore respiratory disease. Wuhan, China, déjà vu. An hysterical\\nmedia told horror stories of Italians dying from ‘Covid’ in their\\ndroves and how Lombardy hospitals were being overrun by a tidal\\nwave of desperately ill people needing treatment a\\x00er being struck\\ndown by the ‘deadly virus’. Here was the psychological turning\\npoint the Cult had planned. Wow, if this is happening in Italy, the\\nWestern mind concluded, this indeed could happen to me and my\\nfamily. Another point is that Italian authorities responded by\\nfollowing the Chinese blueprint so vehemently recommended by the\\nCult-owned World Health Organization. They imposed fascistic\\nlockdowns on the whole country viciously policed with the help of\\nsurveillance drones sweeping through the streets seeking out anyone\\nwho escaped from mass house arrest. Livelihoods were destroyed\\nand psychology unravelled in the way we have witnessed since in all\\nlockdown countries. Crucial to the plan was that Italy responded in\\nthis way to set the precedent of suspending freedom and imposing\\nfascism in a ‘Western liberal democracy’. I emphasised in an animated video explanation on davidicke.com posted in the summer\\nof 2020 how important it was to the Cult to expand the Chinese\\nlockdown model across the West. Without this, and the bare-faced lie\\nthat non-symptomatic people could still transmit a ‘disease’ they\\ndidn’t have, there was no way locking down the whole population,\\nsick and not sick, could be pulled oﬀ. At just the right time and with\\nno evidence Cult operatives and gofers claimed that people without\\nsymptoms could pass on the ‘disease’. In the name of protecting the\\n‘vulnerable’ like elderly people, who lockdowns would kill by the\\ntens of thousands, we had for the ﬁrst time healthy people told to\\nisolate as well as the sick. The great majority of people who tested\\npositive had no symptoms because there was nothing wrong with\\nthem. It was just a trick made possible by a test not testing for the\\n‘virus’.\\nMonths a\\x00er my animated video the Gates-funded Professor Neil\\nFerguson at the Gates-funded Imperial College conﬁrmed that I was\\nright. He didn’t say it in those terms, naturally, but he did say it.\\nFerguson will enter the story shortly for his outrageously crazy\\n‘computer models’ that led to Britain, the United States and many\\nother countries following the Chinese and now Italian methods of\\nresponse. Put another way, following the Cult script. Ferguson said\\nthat SAGE, the UK government’s scientiﬁc advisory group which has\\ncontrolled ‘Covid’ policy from the start, wanted to follow the\\nChinese lockdown model (while they all continued to work and be\\npaid), but they wondered if they could possibly, in Ferguson’s\\nwords, ‘get away with it in Europe’. ‘Get away with it’? Who the hell\\ndo these moronic, arrogant people think they are? This appalling\\nman Ferguson said that once Italy went into national lockdown they\\nrealised they, too, could mimic China:\\nIt’s a communist one-party state, we said. We couldn’t get away with it in Europe, we thought\\n… and then Italy did it. And we realised we could. Behind this garbage from Ferguson is a\\nsimple fact: Doing the same as China in every country was the plan from the start and\\nFerguson’s ‘models’ would play a central role in achieving that. It’s just a coincidence, of\\ncourse, and absolutely nothing to worry your little head about. Oops, sorry, our mistake\\nOnce the Italian segment of the Psyop had done the job it was\\ndesigned to do a very diﬀerent story emerged. Italian authorities\\nrevealed that 99 percent of those who had ‘died from Covid-19’ in\\nItaly had one, two, three, or more ‘co-morbidities’ or illnesses and\\nhealth problems that could have ended their life. The US Centers for\\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a ﬁgure of 94\\npercent for Americans dying of ‘Covid’ while having other serious\\nmedical conditions – on average two to three (some ﬁve or six) other\\npotential causes of death. In terms of death from an unproven ‘virus’\\nI say it is 100 percent. The other one percent in Italy and six percent\\nin the US would presumably have died from ‘Covid’s’ ﬂu-like\\nsymptoms with a range of other possible causes in conjunction with\\na test not testing for the ‘virus’. Fox News reported that even more\\nstartling ﬁgures had emerged in one US county in which 410 of 422\\ndeaths a\\x00ributed to ‘Covid-19’ had other potentially deadly health\\nconditions. The Italian National Health Institute said later that the\\naverage age of people dying with a ‘Covid-19’ diagnosis in Italy was\\nabout 81. Ninety percent were over 70 with ten percent over 90. In\\nterms of other reasons to die some 80 percent had two or more\\nchronic diseases with half having three or more including\\ncardiovascular problems, diabetes, respiratory problems and cancer.\\nWhy is the phantom ‘Covid-19’ said to kill overwhelmingly old\\npeople and hardly aﬀect the young? Old people continually die of\\nmany causes and especially respiratory disease which you can re-\\ndiagnose ‘Covid-19’ while young people die in tiny numbers by\\ncomparison and rarely of respiratory disease. Old people ‘die of\\nCovid’ because they die of other things that can be redesignated\\n‘Covid’ and it really is that simple.\\nFlu has flown\\nThe blueprint was in place. Get your illusory ‘cases’ from a test not\\ntesting for the ‘virus’ and redesignate other causes of death as\\n‘Covid-19’. You have an instant ‘pandemic’ from something that is\\nnothing more than a computer-generated ﬁction. With near-on a billion people having ‘ﬂu-like’ symptoms every year the potential\\nwas limitless and we can see why ﬂu quickly and apparently\\nmiraculously disappeared worldwide by being diagnosed ‘Covid-19’.\\nThe painfully bloody obvious was explained away by the childlike\\nmedia in headlines like this in the UK ‘Independent’: ‘Not a single\\ncase of ﬂu detected by Public Health England this year as Covid\\nrestrictions suppress virus’. I kid you not. The masking, social\\ndistancing and house arrest that did not make the ‘Covid virus’\\ndisappear somehow did so with the ‘ﬂu virus’. Even worse the\\narticle, by a bloke called Samuel Love\\x00, suggested that maybe the\\nmasking, sanitising and other ‘Covid’ measures should continue to\\nkeep the ﬂu away. With a ridiculousness that disturbs your breathing\\n(it’s ‘Covid-19’) the said Love\\x00 wrote: ‘With widespread social\\ndistancing and mask-wearing measures in place throughout the UK,\\nthe usual routes of transmission for inﬂuenza have been blocked.’\\nHe had absolutely no evidence to support that statement, but look at\\nthe consequences of him acknowledging the obvious. With ﬂu not\\ndisappearing at all and only being relabelled ‘Covid-19’ he would\\nhave to contemplate that ‘Covid’ was a hoax on a scale that is hard to\\nimagine. You need guts and commitment to truth to even go there\\nand that’s clearly something Samuel Love\\x00 does not have in\\nabundance. He would never have got it through the editors anyway.\\nTens of thousands die in the United States alone every winter from\\nﬂu including many with pneumonia complications. CDC ﬁgures\\nrecord 45 million Americans diagnosed with ﬂu in 2017-2018 of\\nwhich 61,000 died and some reports claim 80,000. Where was the\\nsame hysteria then that we have seen with ‘Covid-19’? Some 250,000\\nAmericans are admi\\x00ed to hospital with pneumonia every year with\\nabout 50,000 cases proving fatal. About 65 million suﬀer respiratory\\ndisease every year and three million deaths makes this the third\\nbiggest cause of death worldwide. You only have to redesignate a\\nportion of all these people ‘Covid-19’ and you have an instant global\\npandemic or the appearance of one. Why would doctors do this? They\\nare told to do this and all but a few dare not refuse those who must\\nbe obeyed. Doctors in general are not researching their own knowledge and instead take it direct and unquestioned from the\\nauthorities that own them and their careers. The authorities say they\\nmust now diagnose these symptoms ‘Covid-19’ and not ﬂu, or\\nwhatever, and they do it. Dark suits say put ‘Covid-19’ on death\\ncertiﬁcates no ma\\x00er what the cause of death and the doctors do it.\\nRenegade Minds don’t fall for the illusion that doctors and medical\\nstaﬀ are all highly-intelligent, highly-principled, seekers of medical\\ntruth. Some are, but not the majority. They are repeaters, gofers, and\\nyes sir, no sir, purveyors of what the system demands they purvey.\\nThe ‘Covid’ con is not merely conﬁned to diseases of the lungs.\\nInstructions to doctors to put ‘Covid-19’ on death certiﬁcates for\\nanyone dying of anything within 28 days (or much more) of a\\npositive test not testing for the ‘virus’ opened the ﬂoodgates. The\\nterm dying with ‘Covid’ and not of ‘Covid’ was coined to cover the\\ntruth. Whether it was a with or an of they were all added to the death\\nnumbers a\\x00ributed to the ‘deadly virus’ compiled by national\\ngovernments and globally by the Gates-funded Johns Hopkins\\noperation in the United States that was so involved in those\\n‘pandemic’ simulations. Fraudulent deaths were added to the ever-\\ngrowing list of fraudulent ‘cases’ from false positives from a false\\ntest. No wonder Professor Walter Ricciardi, scientiﬁc advisor to the\\nItalian minister of health, said a\\x00er the Lombardy hysteria had done\\nits job that ‘Covid’ death rates were due to Italy having the second\\noldest population in the world and to how hospitals record deaths:\\nThe way in which we code deaths in our country is very generous in the sense that all the\\npeople who die in hospitals with the coronavirus are deemed to be dying of the coronavirus.\\nOn re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates\\nhave shown a direct causality from coronavirus, while 88 per cent of patients who have died\\nhave at least one pre-morbidity – many had two or three.\\nThis is extraordinary enough when you consider the propaganda\\ncampaign to use Italy to terrify the world, but how can they even say\\ntwelve percent were genuine when the ‘virus’ has not been shown to\\nexist, its ‘code’ is a computer program, and diagnosis comes from a\\ntest not testing for it? As in China, and soon the world, ‘Covid-19’ in Italy was a redesignation of diagnosis. Lies and corruption were to\\nbecome the real ‘pandemic’ fuelled by a pathetically-compliant\\nmedical system taking its orders from the tiny few at the top of their\\nnational hierarchy who answered to the World Health Organization\\nwhich answers to Gates and the Cult. Doctors were told – ordered –\\nto diagnose a particular set of symptoms ‘Covid-19’ and put that on\\nthe death certiﬁcate for any cause of death if the patient had tested\\npositive with a test not testing for the virus or had ‘Covid’ symptoms\\nlike the ﬂu. The United States even introduced big ﬁnancial\\nincentives to manipulate the ﬁgures with hospitals receiving £4,600\\nfrom the Medicare system for diagnosing someone with regular\\npneumonia, $13,000 if they made the diagnosis from the same\\nsymptoms ‘Covid-19’ pneumonia, and $39, 000 if they put a ‘Covid’\\ndiagnosed patient on a ventilator that would almost certainly kill\\nthem. A few – painfully and pathetically few – medical\\nwhistleblowers revealed (before Cult-owned YouTube deleted their\\nvideos) that they had been instructed to ‘let the patient crash’ and\\nput them straight on a ventilator instead of going through a series of\\nfar less intrusive and dangerous methods as they would have done\\nbefore the pandemic hoax began and the ﬁnancial incentives kicked\\nin. We are talking cold-blooded murder given that ventilators are so\\ndamaging to respiratory systems they are usually the last step before\\nheaven awaits. Renegade Minds never fall for the belief that people\\nin white coats are all angels of mercy and cannot be full-on\\npsychopaths. I have explained in detail in The Answer how what I am\\ndescribing here played out across the world coordinated by the\\nWorld Health Organization through the medical hierarchies in\\nalmost every country.\\nMedical scientist calls it\\nInformation about the non-existence of the ‘virus’ began to emerge\\nfor me in late March, 2020, and mushroomed a\\x00er that. I was sent an\\nemail by Sir Julian Rose, a writer, researcher, and organic farming\\npromotor, from a medical scientist friend of his in the United States.\\nEven at that early stage in March the scientist was able to explain how the ‘Covid’ hoax was being manipulated. He said there were no\\nreliable tests for a speciﬁc ‘Covid-19 virus’ and nor were there any\\nreliable agencies or media outlets for reporting numbers of actual\\n‘Covid-19’ cases. We have seen in the long period since then that he\\nwas absolutely right. ‘Every action and reaction to Covid-19 is based\\non totally ﬂawed data and we simply cannot make accurate\\nassessments,’ he said. Most people diagnosed with ‘Covid-19’ were\\nshowing nothing more than cold and ﬂu-like symptoms ‘because\\nmost coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/ﬂu-like\\nsymptoms’. We had farcical situations like an 84-year-old German\\nman testing positive for ‘Covid-19’ and his nursing home ordered to\\nquarantine only for him to be found to have a common cold. The\\nscientist described back then why PCR tests and what he called the\\n‘Mickey Mouse test kits’ were useless for what they were claimed to\\nbe identifying. ‘The idea these kits can isolate a speciﬁc virus like\\nCovid-19 is nonsense,’ he said. Signiﬁcantly, he pointed out that ‘if\\nyou want to create a totally false panic about a totally false pandemic\\n– pick a coronavirus’. This is exactly what the Cult-owned Gates,\\nWorld Economic Forum and Johns Hopkins University did with\\ntheir Event 201 ‘simulation’ followed by their real-life simulation\\ncalled the ‘pandemic’. The scientist said that all you had to do was\\nselect the sickest of people with respiratory-type diseases in a single\\nlocation – ‘say Wuhan’ – and administer PCR tests to them. You can\\nthen claim that anyone showing ‘viral sequences’ similar to a\\ncoronavirus ‘which will inevitably be quite a few’ is suﬀering from a\\n‘new’ disease:\\nSince you already selected the sickest flu cases a fairly high proportion of your sample will go\\non to die. You can then say this ‘new’ virus has a CFR [case fatality rate] higher than the flu\\nand use this to infuse more concern and do more tests which will of course produce more\\n‘cases’, which expands the testing, which produces yet more ‘cases’ and so on and so on.\\nBefore long you have your ‘pandemic’, and all you have done is use a simple test kit trick to\\nconvert the worst flu and pneumonia cases into something new that doesn’t ACTUALLY EXIST\\n[my emphasis].\\nHe said that you then ‘just run the same scam in other countries’\\nand make sure to keep the fear message running high ‘so that people •\\n•\\n•\\nwill feel panicky and less able to think critically’. The only problem\\nto overcome was the fact there is no actual new deadly pathogen and\\nonly regular sick people. This meant that deaths from the ‘new\\ndeadly pathogen’ were going to be way too low for a real new\\ndeadly virus pandemic, but he said this could be overcome in the\\nfollowing ways – all of which would go on to happen:\\n1. You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths are imminent [you underpin this\\nwith fantasy ‘computer projections’]. Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and then\\nclaim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.\\n2. You can [say that people] ‘minimizing’ the dangers are irresponsible and bully them into\\nnot talking about numbers.\\n3. You can talk crap about made up numbers hoping to blind people with pseudoscience.\\n4. You can start testing well people (who, of course, will also likely have shreds of\\ncoronavirus [RNA] in them) and thus inﬂate your ‘case ﬁgures’ with ‘asymptomatic\\ncarriers’ (you will of course have to spin that to sound deadly even though any virologist\\nknows the more symptom-less cases you have the less deadly is your pathogen).\\nThe scientist said that if you take these simple steps ‘you can have\\nyour own entirely manufactured pandemic up and running in\\nweeks’. His analysis made so early in the hoax was brilliantly\\nprophetic of what would actually unfold. Pulling all the information\\ntogether in these recent chapters we have this is simple 1, 2, 3, of\\nhow you can delude virtually the entire human population into\\nbelieving in a ‘virus’ that doesn’t exist:\\n \\nA ‘Covid case’ is someone who tests positive with a test not\\ntesting for the ‘virus’.\\n \\nA ‘Covid death’ is someone who dies of any cause within 28 days\\n(or much longer) of testing positive with a test not testing for the\\n‘virus.\\n \\nAsymptomatic means there is nothing wrong with you, but they\\nclaim you can pass on what you don’t have to justify locking down (quarantining) healthy people in totality.\\n \\nThe foundations of the hoax are that simple. A study involving ten\\nmillion people in Wuhan, published in November, 2020, demolished\\nthe whole lie about those without symptoms passing on the ‘virus’.\\nThey found ‘300 asymptomatic cases’ and traced their contacts to\\nﬁnd that not one of them was detected with the ‘virus’.\\n‘Asymptomatic’ patients and their contacts were isolated for no less\\nthan two weeks and nothing changed. I know it’s all crap, but if you\\nare going to claim that those without symptoms can transmit ‘the\\nvirus’ then you must produce evidence for that and they never have.\\nEven World Health Organization oﬃcial Dr Maria Van Kerkhove,\\nhead of the emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said as early as\\nJune, 2020, that she doubted the validity of asymptomatic\\ntransmission. She said that ‘from the data we have, it still seems to\\nbe rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a\\nsecondary individual’ and by ‘rare’ she meant that she couldn’t cite\\nany case of asymptomatic transmission.\\nThe Ferguson factor\\nThe problem for the Cult as it headed into March, 2020, when the\\nscript had lockdown due to start, was that despite all the\\nmanipulation of the case and death ﬁgures they still did not have\\nenough people alleged to have died from ‘Covid’ to justify mass\\nhouse arrest. This was overcome in the way the scientist described:\\n‘You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths are\\nimminent … Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and then\\nclaim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.’ Enter\\none Professor Neil Ferguson, the Gates-funded ‘epidemiologist’ at\\nthe Gates-funded Imperial College in London. Ferguson is Britain’s\\nChristian Drosten in that he has a dire record of predicting health\\noutcomes, but is still called upon to advise government on the next\\nhealth outcome when another ‘crisis’ comes along. This may seem to\\nbe a strange and ridiculous thing to do. Why would you keep\\nturning for policy guidance to people who have a history of being monumentally wrong? Ah, but it makes sense from the Cult point of\\nview. These ‘experts’ keep on producing predictions that suit the\\nCult agenda for societal transformation and so it was with Neil\\nFerguson as he revealed his horriﬁc (and clearly insane) computer\\nmodel predictions that allowed lockdowns to be imposed in Britain,\\nthe United States and many other countries. Ferguson does not have\\neven an A-level in biology and would appear to have no formal\\ntraining in computer modelling, medicine or epidemiology,\\naccording to Derek Winton, an MSc in Computational Intelligence.\\nHe wrote an article somewhat aghast at what Ferguson did which\\nincluded taking no account of respiratory disease ‘seasonality’ which\\nmeans it is far worse in the winter months. Who would have thought\\nthat respiratory disease could be worse in the winter? Well, certainly\\nnot Ferguson.\\nThe massively China-connected Imperial College and its bizarre\\nprofessor provided the excuse for the long-incubated Chinese model\\nof human control to travel westward at lightning speed. Imperial\\nCollege conﬁrms on its website that it collaborates with the Chinese\\nResearch Institute; publishes more than 600 research papers every\\nyear with Chinese research institutions; has 225 Chinese staﬀ; 2,600\\nChinese students – the biggest international group; 7,000 former\\nstudents living in China which is the largest group outside the UK;\\nand was selected for a tour by China’s President Xi Jinping during\\nhis state visit to the UK in 2015. The college takes major donations\\nfrom China and describes itself as the UK’s number one university\\ncollaborator with Chinese research institutions. The China\\ncommunist/fascist government did not appear phased by the woeful\\npredictions of Ferguson and Imperial when during the lockdown\\nthat Ferguson induced the college signed a ﬁve-year collaboration\\ndeal with China tech giant Huawei that will have Huawei’s indoor\\n5G network equipment installed at the college’s West London tech\\ncampus along with an ‘AI cloud platform’. The deal includes Chinese\\nsponsorship of Imperial’s Venture Catalyst entrepreneurship\\ncompetition. Imperial is an example of the enormous inﬂuence the\\nChinese government has within British and North American universities and research centres – and further aﬁeld. Up to 200\\nacademics from more than a dozen UK universities are being\\ninvestigated on suspicion of ‘unintentionally’ helping the Chinese\\ngovernment build weapons of mass destruction by ‘transferring\\nworld-leading research in advanced military technology such as\\naircra\\x00, missile designs and cyberweapons’. Similar scandals have\\nbroken in the United States, but it’s all a coincidence. Imperial\\nCollege serves the agenda in many other ways including the\\npromotion of every aspect of the United Nations Agenda 21/2030\\n(the Great Reset) and produced computer models to show that\\nhuman-caused ‘climate change’ is happening when in the real world\\nit isn’t. Imperial College is driving the climate agenda as it drives the\\n‘Covid’ agenda (both Cult hoaxes) while Patrick Vallance, the UK\\ngovernment’s Chief Scientiﬁc Adviser on ‘Covid’, was named Chief\\nScientiﬁc Adviser to the UN ‘climate change’ conference known as\\nCOP26 hosted by the government in Glasgow, Scotland. ‘Covid’ and\\n‘climate’ are fundamentally connected.\\nProfessor Woeful\\nFrom Imperial’s bosom came Neil Ferguson still advising\\ngovernment despite his previous disasters and it was announced\\nearly on that he and other key people like UK Chief Medical Adviser\\nChris Whi\\x00y had caught the ‘virus’ as the propaganda story was\\nbeing sold. Somehow they managed to survive and we had Prime\\nMinister Boris Johnson admi\\x00ed to hospital with what was said to be\\na severe version of the ‘virus’ in this same period. His whole policy\\nand demeanour changed when he returned to Downing Street. It’s a\\nsmall world with these government advisors – especially in their\\ncommunal connections to Gates – and Ferguson had partnered with\\nWhi\\x00y to write a paper called ‘Infectious disease: Tough choices to\\nreduce Ebola transmission’ which involved another scare-story that\\ndidn’t happen. Ferguson’s ‘models’ predicted that up to150, 000\\ncould die from ‘mad cow disease’, or BSE, and its version in sheep if\\nit was transmi\\x00ed to humans. BSE was not transmi\\x00ed and instead\\ntriggered by an organophosphate pesticide used to treat a pest on cows. Fewer than 200 deaths followed from the human form. Models\\nby Ferguson and his fellow incompetents led to the unnecessary\\nculling of millions of pigs, ca\\x00le and sheep in the foot and mouth\\noutbreak in 2001 which destroyed the lives and livelihoods of\\nfarmers and their families who had o\\x00en spent decades building\\ntheir herds and ﬂocks. Vast numbers of these animals did not have\\nfoot and mouth and had no contact with the infection. Another\\n‘expert’ behind the cull was Professor Roy Anderson, a computer\\nmodeller at Imperial College specialising in the epidemiology of\\nhuman, not animal, disease. Anderson has served on the Bill and\\nMelinda Gates Grand Challenges in Global Health advisory board\\nand chairs another Gates-funded organisation. Gates is everywhere.\\nIn a precursor to the ‘Covid’ script Ferguson backed closing\\nschools ‘for prolonged periods’ over the swine ﬂu ‘pandemic’ in 2009\\nand said it would aﬀect a third of the world population if it\\ncontinued to spread at the speed he claimed to be happening. His\\nmates at Imperial College said much the same and a news report\\nsaid: ‘One of the authors, the epidemiologist and disease modeller\\nNeil Ferguson, who sits on the World Health Organisation’s\\nemergency commi\\x00ee for the outbreak, said the virus had “full\\npandemic potential”.’ Professor Liam Donaldson, the Chris Whi\\x00y\\nof his day as Chief Medical Oﬃcer, said the worst case could see 30\\npercent of the British people infected by swine ﬂu with 65,000 dying.\\nFerguson and Donaldson were indeed proved correct when at the\\nend of the year the number of deaths a\\x00ributed to swine ﬂu was 392.\\nThe term ‘expert’ is rather liberally applied unfortunately, not least\\nto complete idiots. Swine ﬂu ‘projections’ were great for\\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as millions rolled in for its Pandemrix\\ninﬂuenza vaccine which led to brain damage with children most\\naﬀected. The British government (taxpayers) paid out more than £60\\nmillion in compensation a\\x00er GSK was given immunity from\\nprosecution. Yet another ‘Covid’ déjà vu. Swine ﬂu was supposed to\\nhave broken out in Mexico, but Dr Wolfgang Wodarg, a German\\ndoctor, former member of parliament and critic of the ‘Covid’ hoax,\\nobserved ‘the spread of swine ﬂu’ in Mexico City at the time. He said: ‘What we experienced in Mexico City was a very mild ﬂu\\nwhich did not kill more than usual – which killed even fewer people\\nthan usual.’ Hyping the fear against all the facts is not unique to\\n‘Covid’ and has happened many times before. Ferguson is reported\\nto have over-estimated the projected death toll of bird ﬂu (H5N1) by\\nsome three million-fold, but bird ﬂu vaccine makers again made a\\nkilling from the scare. This is some of the background to the Neil\\nFerguson who produced the perfectly-timed computer models in\\nearly 2020 predicting that half a million people would die in Britain\\nwithout draconian lockdown and 2.2 million in the United States.\\nPoliticians panicked, people panicked, and lockdowns of alleged\\nshort duration were instigated to ‘ﬂa\\x00en the curve’ of cases gleaned\\nfrom a test not testing for the ‘virus’. I said at the time that the public\\ncould forget the ‘short duration’ bit. This was an agenda to destroy\\nthe livelihoods of the population and force them into mass control\\nthrough dependency and there was going to be nothing ‘short’ about\\nit. American researcher Daniel Horowitz described the consequences\\nof the ‘models’ spewed out by Gates-funded Ferguson and Imperial\\nCollege:\\nWhat led our government and the governments of many other countries into panic was a\\nsingle Imperial College of UK study, funded by global warming activists, that predicted 2.2\\nmillion deaths if we didn’t lock down the country. In addition, the reported 8-9% death rate in\\nItaly scared us into thinking there was some other mutation of this virus that they got, which\\nmight have come here.\\nTogether with the fact that we were finally testing and had the ability to actually report new\\ncases, we thought we were headed for a death spiral. But again … we can’t flatten a curve if\\nwe don’t know when the curve started.\\nHow about it never started?\\nGiving them what they want\\nAn investigation by German news outlet Welt Am Sonntag (World on\\nSunday) revealed how in March, 2020, the German government\\ngathered together ‘leading scientists from several research institutes\\nand universities’ and ‘together, they were to produce a [modelling] paper that would serve as legitimization for further tough political\\nmeasures’. The Cult agenda was justiﬁed by computer modelling not\\nbased on evidence or reality; it was speciﬁcally constructed to justify\\nthe Cult demand for lockdowns all over the world to destroy the\\nindependent livelihoods of the global population. All these\\nmodellers and everyone responsible for the ‘Covid’ hoax have a date\\nwith a trial like those in Nuremberg a\\x00er World War Two when\\nNazis faced the consequences of their war crimes. These corrupt-\\nbeyond-belief ‘modellers’ wrote the paper according to government\\ninstructions and it said that that if lockdown measures were li\\x00ed\\nthen up to one million Germans would die from ‘Covid-19’ adding\\nthat some would die ‘agonizingly at home, gasping for breath’\\nunable to be treated by hospitals that couldn’t cope. All lies. No\\nma\\x00er – it gave the Cult all that it wanted. What did long-time\\ngovernment ‘modeller’ Neil Ferguson say? If the UK and the United\\nStates didn’t lockdown half a million would die in Britain and 2.2\\nmillion Americans. Anyone see a theme here? ‘Modellers’ are such a\\ncrucial part of the lockdown strategy that we should look into their\\nbackground and follow the money. Researcher Rosemary Frei\\nproduced an excellent article headlined ‘The Modelling-paper\\nMaﬁosi’. She highlights a guy called John Edmunds, a British\\nepidemiologist, and professor in the Faculty of Epidemiology and\\nPopulation Health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical\\nMedicine. He studied at Imperial College. Edmunds is a member of\\ngovernment ‘Covid’ advisory bodies which have been dictating\\npolicy, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory\\nGroup (NERVTAG) and the Scientiﬁc Advisory Group for\\nEmergencies (SAGE).\\nFerguson, another member of NERVTAG and SAGE, led the way\\nwith the original ‘virus’ and Edmunds has followed in the ‘variant’\\nstage and especially the so-called UK or Kent variant known as the\\n‘Variant of Concern’ (VOC) B.1.1.7. He said in a co-wri\\x00en report for\\nthe Centre for Mathematical modelling of Infectious Diseases at the\\nLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, with input from\\nthe Centre’s ‘Covid-19’ Working Group, that there was ‘a realistic possibility that VOC B.1.1.7 is associated with an increased risk of\\ndeath compared to non-VOC viruses’. Fear, fear, fear, get the\\nvaccine, fear, fear, fear, get the vaccine. Rosemary Frei reveals that\\nalmost all the paper’s authors and members of the modelling centre’s\\n‘Covid-19’ Working Group receive funding from the Bill and\\nMelinda Gates Foundation and/or the associated Gates-funded\\nWellcome Trust. The paper was published by e-journal Medr χiv\\nwhich only publishes papers not peer-reviewed and the journal was\\nestablished by an organisation headed by Facebook’s Mark\\nZuckerberg and his missus. What a small world it is. Frei discovered\\nthat Edmunds is on the Scientiﬁc Advisory Board of the Coalition for\\nEpidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) which was established\\nby the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Klaus Schwab’s Davos\\nWorld Economic Forum and Big Pharma giant Wellcome. CEPI was\\n‘launched in Davos [in 2017] to develop vaccines to stop future\\nepidemics’, according to its website. ‘Our mission is to accelerate the\\ndevelopment of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and\\nenable equitable access to these vaccines for people during\\noutbreaks.’ What kind people they are. Rosemary Frei reveals that\\nPublic Health England (PHE) director Susan Hopkins is an author of\\nher organisation’s non-peer-reviewed reports on ‘new variants’.\\nHopkins is a professor of infectious diseases at London’s Imperial\\nCollege which is gi\\x00ed tens of millions of dollars a year by the Bill\\nand Melinda Gates Foundation. Gates-funded modelling disaster\\nNeil Ferguson also co-authors Public Health England reports and he\\nspoke in December, 2020, about the potential danger of the B.1.1.7.\\n‘UK variant’ promoted by Gates-funded modeller John Edmunds.\\nWhen I come to the ‘Covid vaccines’ the ‘new variants’ will be\\nshown for what they are – bollocks.\\nConnections, connections\\nAll these people and modellers are lockdown-obsessed or, put\\nanother way, they demand what the Cult demands. Edmunds said in\\nJanuary, 2021, that to ease lockdowns too soon would be a disaster\\nand they had to ‘vaccinate much, much, much more widely than the elderly’. Rosemary Frei highlights that Edmunds is married to\\nJeanne Pimenta who is described in a LinkedIn proﬁle as director of\\nepidemiology at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and she held shares in the\\ncompany. Patrick Vallance, co-chair of SAGE and the government’s\\nChief Scientiﬁc Adviser, is a former executive of GSK and has a\\ndeferred bonus of shares in the company worth £600,000. GSK has\\nserious business connections with Bill Gates and is collaborating\\nwith mRNA-’vaccine’ company CureVac to make ‘vaccines’ for the\\nnew variants that Edmunds is talking about. GSK is planning a\\n‘Covid vaccine’ with drug giant Sanoﬁ. Puppet Prime Minister Boris\\nJohnson announced in the spring of 2021 that up to 60 million\\nvaccine doses were to be made at the GSK facility at Barnard Castle\\nin the English North East. Barnard Castle, with a population of just\\n6,000, was famously visited in breach of lockdown rules in April,\\n2020, by Johnson aide Dominic Cummings who said that he drove\\nthere ‘to test his eyesight’ before driving back to London. Cummings\\nwould be be\\x00er advised to test his integrity – not that it would take\\nlong. The GSK facility had nothing to do with his visit then although\\nI’m sure Patrick Vallance would have been happy to arrange an\\nintroduction and some tea and biscuits. Ruthless psychopath Gates\\nhas made yet another fortune from vaccines in collaboration with Big\\nPharma companies and gushes at the phenomenal proﬁts to be made\\nfrom vaccines – more than a 20-to-1 return as he told one\\ninterviewer. Gates also tweeted in December, 2019, with the\\nforeknowledge of what was coming: ‘What’s next for our\\nfoundation? I’m particularly excited about what the next year could\\nmean for one of the best buys in global health: vaccines.’\\nModeller John Edmunds is a big promotor of vaccines as all these\\npeople appear to be. He’s the dean of the London School of Hygiene\\n& Tropical Medicine’s Faculty of Epidemiology and Population\\nHealth which is primarily funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates\\nFoundation and the Gates-established and funded GAVI vaccine\\nalliance which is the Gates vehicle to vaccinate the world. The\\norganisation Doctors Without Borders has described GAVI as being\\n‘aimed more at supporting drug-industry desires to promote new products than at ﬁnding the most eﬃcient and sustainable means for\\nﬁghting the diseases of poverty’. But then that’s why the psychopath\\nGates created it. John Edmunds said in a video that the London\\nSchool of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is involved in every aspect of\\nvaccine development including large-scale clinical trials. He\\ncontends that mathematical modelling can show that vaccines\\nprotect individuals and society. That’s on the basis of shit in and shit\\nout, I take it. Edmunds serves on the UK Vaccine Network as does\\nFerguson and the government’s foremost ‘Covid’ adviser, the grim-\\nfaced, dark-eyed Chris Whi\\x00y. The Vaccine Network says it works\\n‘to support the government to identify and shortlist targeted\\ninvestment opportunities for the most promising vaccines and\\nvaccine technologies that will help combat infectious diseases with\\nepidemic potential, and to address structural issues related to the\\nUK’s broader vaccine infrastructure’. Ferguson is acting Director of\\nthe Imperial College Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium which\\nhas funding from the Bill and Melina Gates Foundation and the\\nGates-created GAVI ‘vaccine alliance’. Anyone wonder why these\\ncharacters see vaccines as the answer to every problem? Ferguson is\\nwildly enthusiastic in his support for GAVI’s campaign to vaccine\\nchildren en masse in poor countries. You would expect someone like\\nGates who has constantly talked about the need to reduce the\\npopulation to want to fund vaccines to keep more people alive. I’m\\nsure that’s why he does it. The John Edmunds London School of\\nHygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) has a Vaccines\\nManufacturing Innovation Centre which develops, tests and\\ncommercialises vaccines. Rosemary Frei writes:\\nThe vaccines centre also performs affiliated activities like combating ‘vaccine hesitancy’. The\\nlatter includes the Vaccine Confidence Project. The project’s stated purpose is, among other\\nthings, ‘to provide analysis and guidance for early response and engagement with the public\\nto ensure sustained confidence in vaccines and immunisation’. The Vaccine Confidence\\nProject’s director is LSHTM professor Heidi Larson. For more than a decade she’s been\\nresearching how to combat vaccine hesitancy.\\nHow the bloody hell can blokes like John Edmunds and Neil\\nFerguson with those connections and ﬁnancial ties model ‘virus’ case and death projections for the government and especially in a way\\nthat gives their paymasters like Gates exactly what they want? It’s\\ninsane, but this is what you ﬁnd throughout the world.\\n‘Covid’ is not dangerous, oops, wait, yes it is\\nOnly days before Ferguson’s nightmare scenario made Jackboot\\nJohnson take Britain into a China-style lockdown to save us from a\\ndeadly ‘virus’ the UK government website gov.uk was reporting\\nsomething very diﬀerent to Ferguson on a page of oﬃcial\\ngovernment guidance for ‘high consequence infectious diseases\\n(HCID)’. It said this about ‘Covid-19’:\\nAs of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious\\ndiseases (HCID) in the UK [my emphasis]. The 4 nations public health HCID group made an\\ninterim recommendation in January 2020 to classify COVID-19 as an HCID. This was based\\non consideration of the UK HCID criteria about the virus and the disease with information\\navailable during the early stages of the outbreak.\\nNow that more is known about COVID-19, the public health bodies in the UK have reviewed\\nthe most up to date information about COVID-19 against the UK HCID criteria. They have\\ndetermined that several features have now changed; in particular, more information is\\navailable about mortality rates (low overall), and there is now greater clinical awareness and a\\nspecific and sensitive laboratory test, the availability of which continues to increase. The\\nAdvisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) is also of the opinion that COVID-19\\nshould no longer be classified as an HCID.\\nSoon a\\x00er the government had been exposed for downgrading the\\nrisk they upgraded it again and everyone was back to singing from\\nthe same Cult hymn book. Ferguson and his fellow Gates clones\\nindicated that lockdowns and restrictions would have to continue\\nuntil a Gates-funded vaccine was developed. Gates said the same\\nbecause Ferguson and his like were repeating the Gates script which\\nis the Cult script. ‘Fla\\x00en the curve’ became an ongoing nightmare of\\ncontinuing lockdowns with periods in between of severe restrictions\\nin pursuit of destroying independent incomes and had nothing to do\\nwith protecting health about which the Cult gives not a shit. Why\\nwouldn’t Ferguson be pushing a vaccine ‘solution’ when he’s owned\\nby vaccine-obsessive Gates who makes a fortune from them and when Ferguson heads the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium at\\nImperial College funded by the Gates Foundation and GAVI, the\\n‘vaccine alliance’, created by Gates as his personal vaccine\\npromotion operation? To compound the human catastrophe that\\nFerguson’s ‘models’ did so much to create he was later exposed for\\nbreaking his own lockdown rules by having sexual liaisons with his\\nmarried girlfriend Antonia Staats at his home while she was living at\\nanother location with her husband and children. Staats was a\\n‘climate’ activist and senior campaigner at the Soros-funded Avaaz\\nwhich I wouldn’t trust to tell me that grass is green. Ferguson had to\\nresign as a government advisor over this hypocrisy in May, 2020, but\\na\\x00er a period of quiet he was back being quoted by the ridiculous\\nmedia on the need for more lockdowns and a vaccine rollout. Other\\ngovernment-advising ‘scientists’ from Imperial College’ held the fort\\nin his absence and said lockdown could be indeﬁnite until a vaccine\\nwas found. The Cult script was being sung by the payrolled choir. I\\nsaid there was no intention of going back to ‘normal’ when the\\n‘vaccine’ came because the ‘vaccine’ is part of a very diﬀerent agenda\\nthat I will discuss in Human 2.0. Why would the Cult want to let the\\nworld go back to normal when destroying that normal forever was\\nthe whole point of what was happening? House arrest, closing\\nbusinesses and schools through lockdown, (un)social distancing and\\nmasks all followed the Ferguson fantasy models. Again as I\\npredicted (these people are so predictable) when the ‘vaccine’\\narrived we were told that house arrest, lockdown, (un)social\\ndistancing and masks would still have to continue. I will deal with\\nthe masks in the next chapter because they are of fundamental\\nimportance.\\nWhere’s the ‘pandemic’?\\nAny mildly in-depth assessment of the ﬁgures revealed what was\\nreally going on. Cult-funded and controlled organisations still have\\ngenuine people working within them such is the number involved.\\nSo it is with Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the\\nApplied Economics master’s degree program at Johns Hopkins University. She analysed the impact that ‘Covid-19’ had on deaths\\nfrom all causes in the United States using oﬃcial data from the CDC\\nfor the period from early February to early September, 2020. She\\nfound that allegedly ‘Covid’ related-deaths exceeded those from\\nheart disease which she found strange with heart disease always the\\nbiggest cause of fatalities. Her research became even more signiﬁcant\\nwhen she noted the sudden decline in 2020 of all non-’Covid’ deaths:\\n‘This trend is completely contrary to the pa\\x00ern observed in all\\nprevious years … the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost\\nexactly equals the increase in deaths by Covid-19.’ This was such a\\ngame, set and match in terms of what was happening that Johns\\nHopkins University deleted the article on the grounds that it ‘was\\nbeing used to support false and dangerous inaccuracies about the\\nimpact of the pandemic’. No – because it exposed the scam from\\noﬃcial CDC ﬁgures and this was conﬁrmed when those ﬁgures were\\npublished in January, 2021. Here we can see the eﬀect of people\\ndying from heart a\\x00acks, cancer, road accidents and gunshot\\nwounds – anything – having ‘Covid-19’ on the death certiﬁcate along\\nwith those diagnosed from ‘symptoms’ who had even not tested\\npositive with a test not testing for the ‘virus’. I am not kidding with\\nthe gunshot wounds, by the way. Brenda Bock, coroner in Grand\\nCounty, Colorado, revealed that two gunshot victims tested positive\\nfor the ‘virus’ within the previous 30 days and were therefore\\nclassiﬁed as ‘Covid deaths’. Bock said: ‘These two people had tested\\npositive for Covid, but that’s not what killed them. A gunshot\\nwound is what killed them.’ She said she had not even ﬁnished her\\ninvestigation when the state listed the gunshot victims as deaths due\\nto the ‘virus’. The death and case ﬁgures for ‘Covid-19’ are an\\nabsolute joke and yet they are repeated like parrots by the media,\\npoliticians and alleged medical ‘experts’. The oﬃcial Cult narrative\\nis the only show in town.\\nGenevieve Briand found that deaths from all causes were not\\nexceptional in 2020 compared with previous years and a Spanish\\nmagazine published ﬁgures that said the same about Spain which\\nwas a ‘Covid’ propaganda hotspot at one point. Discovery Salud, a health and medicine magazine, quoted government ﬁgures which\\nshowed how 17,000 fewer people died in Spain in 2020 than in 2019\\nand more than 26,000 fewer than in 2018. The age-standardised\\nmortality rate for England and Wales when age distribution is taken\\ninto account was signiﬁcantly lower in 2020 than the 1970s, 80s and\\n90s, and was only the ninth highest since 2000. Where is the\\n‘pandemic’?\\nPost mortems and autopsies virtually disappeared for ‘Covid’\\ndeaths amid claims that ‘virus-infected’ bodily ﬂuids posed a risk to\\nthose carrying out the autopsy. This was rejected by renowned\\nGerman pathologist and forensic doctor Klaus Püschel who said that\\nhe and his staﬀ had by then done 150 autopsies on ‘Covid’ patients\\nwith no problems at all. He said they were needed to know why\\nsome ‘Covid’ patients suﬀered blood clots and not severe respiratory\\ninfections. The ‘virus’ is, a\\x00er all, called SARS or ‘severe acute\\nrespiratory syndrome’. I highlighted in the spring of 2020 this\\nphenomenon and quoted New York intensive care doctor Cameron\\nKyle-Sidell who posted a soon deleted YouTube video to say that\\nthey had been told to prepare to treat an infectious disease called\\n‘Covid-19’, but that was not what they were dealing with. Instead he\\nlikened the lung condition of the most severely ill patients to what\\nyou would expect with cabin depressurisation in a plane at 30,000\\nfeet or someone dropped on the top of Everest without oxygen or\\nacclimatisation. I have never said this is not happening to a small\\nminority of alleged ‘Covid’ patients – I am saying this is not caused\\nby a phantom ‘contagious virus’. Indeed Kyle-Sidell said that\\n‘Covid-19’ was not the disease they were told was coming their way.\\n‘We are operating under a medical paradigm that is untrue,’ he said,\\nand he believed they were treating the wrong disease: ‘These people\\nare being slowly starved of oxygen.’ Patients would take oﬀ their\\noxygen masks in a state of fear and stress and while they were blue\\nin the face on the brink of death. They did not look like patients\\ndying of pneumonia. You can see why they don’t want autopsies\\nwhen their virus doesn’t exist and there is another condition in some\\npeople that they don’t wish to be uncovered. I should add here that the 5G system of millimetre waves was being rapidly introduced\\naround the world in 2020 and even more so now as they ﬁre 5G at\\nthe Earth from satellites. At 60 gigahertz within the 5G range that\\nfrequency interacts with the oxygen molecule and stops people\\nbreathing in suﬃcient oxygen to be absorbed into the bloodstream.\\nThey are installing 5G in schools and hospitals. The world is not\\nmad or anything. 5G can cause major changes to the lungs and blood\\nas I detail in The Answer and these consequences are labelled ‘Covid-\\n19’, the alleged symptoms of which can be caused by 5G and other\\nelectromagnetic frequencies as cells respond to radiation poisoning.\\nThe ‘Covid death’ scam\\nDr Sco\\x00 Jensen, a Minnesota state senator and medical doctor,\\nexposed ‘Covid’ Medicare payment incentives to hospitals and death\\ncertiﬁcate manipulation. He said he was sent a seven-page document\\nby the US Department of Health ‘coaching’ him on how to ﬁll out\\ndeath certiﬁcates which had never happened before. The document\\nsaid that he didn’t need to have a laboratory test for ‘Covid-19’ to\\nput that on the death certiﬁcate and that shocked him when death\\ncertiﬁcates are supposed to be about facts. Jensen described how\\ndoctors had been ‘encouraged, if not pressured’ to make a diagnosis\\nof ‘Covid-19’ if they thought it was probable or ‘presumed’. No\\npositive test was necessary – not that this would have ma\\x00ered\\nanyway. He said doctors were told to diagnose ‘Covid’ by symptoms\\nwhen these were the same as colds, allergies, other respiratory\\nproblems, and certainly with inﬂuenza which ‘disappeared’ in the\\n‘Covid’ era. A common sniﬄe was enough to get the dreaded\\nverdict. Ontario authorities decreed that a single care home resident\\nwith one symptom from a long list must lead to the isolation of the\\nentire home. Other courageous doctors like Jensen made the same\\npoint about death ﬁgure manipulation and how deaths by other\\ncauses were falling while ‘Covid-19 deaths’ were rising at the same\\nrate due to re-diagnosis. Their videos rarely survive long on\\nYouTube with its Cult-supporting algorithms courtesy of CEO Susan\\nWojcicki and her bosses at Google. Figure-tampering was so glaring and ubiquitous that even oﬃcials were le\\x00ing it slip or outright\\nsaying it. UK chief scientiﬁc adviser Patrick Vallance said on one\\noccasion that ‘Covid’ on the death certiﬁcate doesn’t mean ‘Covid’\\nwas the cause of death (so why the hell is it there?) and we had the\\nrare sight of a BBC reporter telling the truth when she said:\\n‘Someone could be successfully treated for Covid, in say April,\\ndischarged, and then in June, get run over by a bus and die … That\\nperson would still be counted as a Covid death in England.’ Yet the\\nBBC and the rest of the world media went on repeating the case and\\ndeath ﬁgures as if they were real. Illinois Public Health Director Dr\\nNgozi Ezike revealed the deceit while her bosses must have been\\nclenching their bu\\x00ocks:\\nIf you were in a hospice and given a few weeks to live and you were then found to have\\nCovid that would be counted as a Covid death. [There might be] a clear alternate cause, but it\\nis still listed as a Covid death. So everyone listed as a Covid death doesn’t mean that was the\\ncause of the death, but that they had Covid at the time of death.\\nYes, a ‘Covid virus’ never shown to exist and tested for with a test\\nnot testing for the ‘virus’. In the ﬁrst period of the pandemic hoax\\nthrough the spring of 2020 the process began of designating almost\\neverything a ‘Covid’ death and this has continued ever since. I sat in\\na restaurant one night listening to a loud conversation on the next\\ntable where a family was discussing in bewilderment how a relative\\nwho had no symptoms of ‘Covid’, and had died of a long-term\\nproblem, could have been diagnosed a death by the ‘virus’. I could\\nunderstand their bewilderment. If they read this book they will\\nknow why this medical fraud has been perpetrated the world over.\\nSome media truth shock\\nThe media ignored the evidence of death certiﬁcate fraud until\\neventually one columnist did speak out when she saw it ﬁrst-hand.\\nBel Mooney is a long-time national newspaper journalist in Britain\\ncurrently working for the Daily Mail. Her article on February 19th,\\n2021, carried this headline: ‘My dad Ted passed three Covid tests and died of a chronic illness yet he’s oﬃcially one of Britain’s 120,000\\nvictims of the virus and is far from alone ... so how many more are\\nthere?’ She told how her 99-year-old father was in a care home with\\na long-standing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and vascular\\ndementia. Maybe, but he was still aware enough to tell her from the\\nstart that there was no ‘virus’ and he refused the ‘vaccine’ for that\\nreason. His death was not unexpected given his chronic health\\nproblems and Mooney said she was shocked to ﬁnd that ‘Covid-19’\\nwas declared the cause of death on his death certiﬁcate. She said this\\nwas a ‘bizarre and unacceptable untruth’ for a man with long-time\\nhealth problems who had tested negative twice at the home for the\\n‘virus’. I was also shocked by this story although not by what she\\nsaid. I had been highlighting the death certiﬁcate manipulation for\\nten months. It was the conﬁrmation that a professional full-time\\njournalist only realised this was going on when it aﬀected her\\ndirectly and neither did she know that whether her dad tested\\npositive or negative was irrelevant with the test not testing for the\\n‘virus’. Where had she been? She said she did not believe in\\n‘conspiracy theories’ without knowing I’m sure that this and\\n‘conspiracy theorists’ were terms put into widespread circulation by\\nthe CIA in the 1960s to discredit those who did not accept the\\nridiculous oﬃcial story of the Kennedy assassination. A blanket\\nstatement of ‘I don’t believe in conspiracy theories’ is always bizarre.\\nThe dictionary deﬁnition of the term alone means the world is\\ndrowning in conspiracies. What she said was even more da\\x00 when\\nher dad had just been aﬀected by the ‘Covid’ conspiracy. Why else\\ndoes she think that ‘Covid-19’ was going on the death certiﬁcates of\\npeople who died of something else?\\nTo be fair once she saw from personal experience what was\\nhappening she didn’t mince words. Mooney was called by the care\\nhome on the morning of February 9th to be told her father had died\\nin his sleep. When she asked for the oﬃcial cause of death what\\ncame back was ‘Covid-19’. Mooney challenged this and was told\\nthere had been deaths from Covid on the dementia ﬂoor (conﬁrmed\\nby a test not testing for the ‘virus’) so they considered it ‘reasonable to assume’. ‘But doctor,’ Mooney rightly protested, ‘an assumption\\nisn’t a diagnosis.’ She said she didn’t blame the perfectly decent and\\nsympathetic doctor – ‘he was just doing his job’. Sorry, but that’s\\nbullshit. He wasn’t doing his job at all. He was pu\\x00ing a false cause of\\ndeath on the death certiﬁcate and that is a criminal oﬀence for which\\nhe should be brought to account and the same with the millions of\\ndoctors worldwide who have done the same. They were not doing\\ntheir job they were following orders and that must not wash at new\\nNuremberg trials any more than it did at the ﬁrst ones. Mooney’s\\ndoctor was ‘assuming’ (presuming) as he was told to, but ‘just\\nfollowing orders’ makes no diﬀerence to his actions. A doctor’s job is\\nto serve the patient and the truth, not follow orders, but that’s what\\nthey have done all over the world and played a central part in\\nmaking the ‘Covid’ hoax possible with all its catastrophic\\nconsequences for humanity. Shame on them and they must answer\\nfor their actions. Mooney said her disquiet worsened when she\\nregistered her father’s death by telephone and was told by the\\nregistrar there had been very many other cases like hers where ‘the\\ndeceased’ had not tested positive for ‘Covid’ yet it was recorded as\\nthe cause of death. The test may not ma\\x00er, but those involved at\\ntheir level think it ma\\x00ers and it shows a callous disregard for\\naccurate diagnosis. The pressure to do this is coming from the top of\\nthe national ‘health’ pyramids which in turn obey the World Health\\nOrganization which obeys Gates and the Cult. Mooney said the\\nregistrar agreed that this must distort the national ﬁgures adding\\nthat ‘the strangest thing is that every winter we record countless\\ndeaths from ﬂu, and this winter there have been none. Not one!’ She\\nasked if the registrar thought deaths from ﬂu were being\\nmisdiagnosed and lumped together with ‘Covid’ deaths. The answer\\nwas a ‘puzzled yes’. Mooney said that the funeral director said the\\nsame about ‘Covid’ deaths which had nothing to do with ‘Covid’.\\nThey had lost count of the number of families upset by this and\\nother funeral companies in diﬀerent countries have had the same\\nexperience. Mooney wrote: The nightly shroud-waving and shocking close-ups of pain imposed on us by the TV news\\nbewildered and terrified the population into eager compliance with lockdowns. We were\\ninvited to ‘save the NHS’ and to grieve for strangers – the real-life loved ones behind those\\nshocking death counts. Why would the public imagine what I now fear, namely that the way\\nCovid-19 death statistics are compiled might make the numbers seem greater than they are?\\nOh, just a li\\x00le bit – like 100 percent.\\nDo the maths\\nMooney asked why a country would wish to skew its mortality\\nﬁgures by wrongly certifying deaths? What had been going on?\\nWell, if you don’t believe in conspiracies you will never ﬁnd the\\nanswer which is that it’s a conspiracy. She did, however, describe\\nwhat she had discovered as a ‘national scandal’. In reality it’s a\\nglobal scandal and happening everywhere. Pillars of this conspiracy\\nwere all put into place before the bu\\x00on was pressed with the\\nDrosten PCR protocol and high ampliﬁcations to produce the cases\\nand death certiﬁcate changes to secure illusory ‘Covid’ deaths.\\nMooney notes that normally two doctors were needed to certify a\\ndeath, with one having to know the patient, and how the rules were\\nchanged in the spring of 2020 to allow one doctor to do this. In the\\nsame period ‘Covid deaths’ were decreed to be all cases where\\nCovid-19 was put on the death certiﬁcate even without a positive test\\nor any symptoms. Mooney asked: ‘How many of the 30,851 (as of\\nJanuary 15) care home resident deaths with Covid-19 on the\\ncertiﬁcate (32.4 per cent of all deaths so far) were based on an\\nassumption, like that of my father? And what has that done to our\\nnational psyche?’All of them is the answer to the ﬁrst question and it\\nhas devastated and dismantled the national psyche, actually the\\nglobal psyche, on a colossal scale. In the UK case and death data is\\ncompiled by organisations like Public Health England (PHE) and the\\nOﬃce for National Statistics (ONS). Mooney highlights the insane\\npolicy of counting a death from any cause as ‘Covid-19’ if this\\nhappens within 28 days of a positive test (with a test not testing for\\nthe ‘virus’) and she points out that ONS statistics reﬂect deaths\\n‘involving Covid’ ‘or due to Covid’ which meant in practice any death where ‘Covid-19’ was mentioned on the death certiﬁcate. She\\ndescribed the consequences of this fraud:\\nMost people will accept the narrative they are fed, so panicky governments here and in\\nEurope witnessed the harsh measures enacted in totalitarian China and jumped into\\nlockdown. Headlines about Covid deaths tolled like the knell that would bring doomsday to\\nus all. Fear stalked our empty streets. Politicians parroted the frankly ridiculous aim of ‘zero\\nCovid’ and shut down the economy, while most British people agreed that lockdown was\\nessential and (astonishingly to me, as a patriotic Brit) even wanted more restrictions.\\nFor what? Lies on death certificates? Never mind the grim toll of lives ruined, suicides, schools\\nclosed, rising inequality, depression, cancelled hospital treatments, cancer patients in a torture\\nof waiting, poverty, economic devastation, loneliness, families kept apart, and so on. How\\nmany lives have been lost as a direct result of lockdown?\\nShe said that we could join in a national chorus of shock and horror\\nat reaching the 120,000 death toll which was surely certain to have\\nbeen totally skewed all along, but what about the human cost of\\nlockdown justiﬁed by these ‘death ﬁgures’? The British Medical\\nJournal had reported a 1,493 percent increase in cases of children\\ntaken to Great Ormond Street Hospital with abusive head injuries\\nalone and then there was the eﬀect on families:\\nPerhaps the most shocking thing about all this is that families have been kept apart – and\\nobeyed the most irrational, changing rules at the whim of government – because they\\nbelieved in the statistics. They succumbed to fear, which his generation rejected in that war\\nfought for freedom. Dad (God rest his soul) would be angry. And so am I.\\nAnother theme to watch is that in the winter months when there\\nare more deaths from all causes they focus on ‘Covid’ deaths and in\\nthe summer when the British Lung Foundation says respiratory\\ndisease plummets by 80 percent they rage on about ‘cases’. Either\\nway fascism on population is always the answer.\\nNazi eugenics in the 21st century\\nElderly people in care homes have been isolated from their families\\nmonth a\\x00er lonely month with no contact with relatives and\\ngrandchildren who were banned from seeing them. We were told that lockdown fascism was to ‘protect the vulnerable’ like elderly\\npeople. At the same time Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders were\\nplaced on their medical ﬁles so that if they needed resuscitation it\\nwasn’t done and ‘Covid-19’ went on their death certiﬁcates. Old\\npeople were not being ‘protected’ they were being culled –\\nmurdered in truth. DNR orders were being decreed for disabled and\\nyoung people with learning diﬃculties or psychological problems.\\nThe UK Care Quality Commission, a non-departmental body of the\\nDepartment of Health and Social Care, found that 34 percent of\\nthose working in health and social care were pressured into placing\\n‘do not a\\x00empt cardiopulmonary resuscitation’ orders on ‘Covid’\\npatients who suﬀered from disabilities and learning diﬃculties\\nwithout involving the patient or their families in the decision. UK\\njudges ruled that an elderly woman with dementia should have the\\nDNA-manipulating ‘Covid vaccine’ against her son’s wishes and that\\na man with severe learning diﬃculties should have the jab despite\\nhis family’s objections. Never mind that many had already died. The\\njudiciary always supports doctors and government in fascist\\ndictatorships. They wouldn’t dare do otherwise. A horriﬁc video was\\nposted showing fascist oﬃcers from Los Angeles police forcibly\\ngiving the ‘Covid’ shot to women with special needs who were\\nscreaming that they didn’t want it. The same fascists are seen giving\\nthe jab to a sleeping elderly woman in a care home. This is straight\\nout of the Nazi playbook. Hitler’s Nazis commi\\x00ed mass murder of\\nthe mentally ill and physically disabled throughout Germany and\\noccupied territories in the programme that became known as Aktion\\nT4, or just T4. Sabbatian-controlled Hitler and his grotesque crazies\\nset out to kill those they considered useless and unnecessary. The\\nReich Commi\\x00ee for the Scientiﬁc Registering of Hereditary and\\nCongenital Illnesses registered the births of babies identiﬁed by\\nphysicians to have ‘defects’. By 1941 alone more than 5,000 children\\nwere murdered by the state and it is estimated that in total the\\nnumber of innocent people killed in Aktion T4 was between 275,000\\nand 300,000. Parents were told their children had been sent away for\\n‘special treatment’ never to return. It is rather pathetic to see claims\\nabout plans for new extermination camps being dismissed today when the same force behind current events did precisely that 80\\nyears ago. Margaret Sanger was a Cult operative who used ‘birth\\ncontrol’ to sanitise her programme of eugenics. Organisations she\\nfounded became what is now Planned Parenthood. Sanger proposed\\nthat ‘the whole dysgenic population would have its choice of\\nsegregation or sterilization’. These included epileptics, ‘feeble-\\nminded’, and prostitutes. Sanger opposed charity because it\\nperpetuated ‘human waste‘. She reveals the Cult mentality and if\\nanyone thinks that extermination camps are a ‘conspiracy theory’\\ntheir naivety is touching if breathtakingly stupid.\\nIf you don’t believe that doctors can act with callous disregard for\\ntheir patients it is worth considering that doctors and medical staﬀ\\nagreed to put government-decreed DNR orders on medical ﬁles and\\ndo nothing when resuscitation is called for. I don’t know what you\\ncall such people in your house. In mine they are Nazis from the Josef\\nMengele School of Medicine. Phenomenal numbers of old people\\nhave died worldwide from the eﬀects of lockdown, depression, lack\\nof treatment, the ‘vaccine’ (more later) and losing the will to live. A\\ncommon response at the start of the manufactured pandemic was to\\nremove old people from hospital beds and transfer them to nursing\\nhomes. The decision would result in a mass cull of elderly people in\\nthose homes through lack of treatment – not ‘Covid’. Care home\\nwhistleblowers have told how once the ‘Covid’ era began doctors\\nwould not come to their homes to treat patients and they were\\nbegging for drugs like antibiotics that o\\x00en never came. The most\\ninfamous example was ordered by New York governor Andrew\\nCuomo, brother of a moronic CNN host, who amazingly was given\\nan Emmy Award for his handling of the ‘Covid crisis’ by the\\nridiculous Wokers that hand them out. Just how ridiculous could be\\nseen in February, 2021, when a Department of Justice and FBI\\ninvestigation began into how thousands of old people in New York\\ndied in nursing homes a\\x00er being discharged from hospital to make\\nway for ‘Covid’ patients on Cuomo’s say-so – and how he and his\\nstaﬀ covered up these facts. This couldn’t have happened to a nicer\\npsychopath. Even then there was a ‘Covid’ spin. Reports said that thousands of old people who tested positive for ‘Covid’ in hospital\\nwere transferred to nursing homes to both die of ‘Covid’ and\\ntransmit it to others. No – they were in hospital because they were ill\\nand the fact that they tested positive with a test not testing for the\\n‘virus’ is irrelevant. They were ill o\\x00en with respiratory diseases\\nubiquitous in old people near the end of their lives. Their transfer\\nout of hospital meant that their treatment stopped and many would\\ngo on to die.\\nThey’re old. Who gives a damn?\\nI have exposed in the books for decades the Cult plan to cull the\\nworld’s old people and even to introduce at some point what they\\ncall a ‘demise pill’ which at a certain age everyone would take and\\nbe out of here by law. In March, 2021, Spain legalised euthanasia and\\nassisted suicide following the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg\\nand Canada on the Tiptoe to the demise pill. Treatment of old people\\nby many ‘care’ homes has been a disgrace in the ‘Covid’ era. There\\nare many, many, caring staﬀ – I know some. There have, however,\\nbeen legions of stories about callous treatment of old people and\\ntheir families. Police were called when families came to take their\\nloved ones home in the light of isolation that was killing them. They\\nbecame prisoners of the state. Care home residents in insane, fascist\\nOntario, Canada, were not allowed to leave their room once the\\n‘Covid’ hoax began. UK staﬀ have even wheeled elderly people\\naway from windows where family members were talking with them.\\nOriana Criscuolo from Stockport in the English North West dropped\\noﬀ some things for her 80-year-old father who has Parkinson’s\\ndisease and dementia and she wanted to wave to him through a\\nground-ﬂoor window. She was told that was ‘illegal’. When she went\\nanyway they closed the curtains in the middle of the day. Oriana\\nsaid:\\nIt’s just unbelievable. I cannot understand how care home staff – people who are being paid\\nto care – have become so uncaring. Their behaviour is inhumane and cruel. It’s beyond belief. She was right and this was not a one-oﬀ. What a way to end your life\\nin such loveless circumstances. UK registered nurse Nicky Millen, a\\nproper old school nurse for 40 years, said that when she started her\\ncareer care was based on dignity, choice, compassion and empathy.\\nNow she said ‘the things that are important to me have gone out of\\nthe window.’ She was appalled that people were dying without their\\nloved ones and saying goodbye on iPads. Nicky described how a\\ndistressed 89-year-old lady stroked her face and asked her ‘how\\nmany paracetamol would it take to ﬁnish me oﬀ’. Life was no longer\\nworth living while not seeing her family. Nicky said she was\\nhumiliated in front of the ward staﬀ and patients for le\\x00ing the lady\\nstroke her face and giving her a cuddle. Such is the dehumanisation\\nthat the ‘Covid’ hoax has brought to the surface. Nicky worked in\\ncare homes where patients told her they were being held prisoner. ‘I\\nwant to live until I die’, one said to her. ‘I had a lady in tears because\\nshe hadn’t seen her great-grandson.’ Nicky was compassionate old\\nschool meeting psychopathic New Normal. She also said she had\\nworked on a ‘Covid’ ward with no ‘Covid’ patients. Jewish writer\\nShai Held wrote an article in March, 2020, which was headlined ‘The\\nStaggering, Heartless Cruelty Toward the Elderly’. What he\\ndescribed was happening from the earliest days of lockdown. He\\nsaid ‘the elderly’ were considered a group and not unique\\nindividuals (the way of the Woke). Shai Held said:\\nNotice how the all-too-familiar rhetoric of dehumanization works: ‘The elderly’ are bunched\\ntogether as a faceless mass, all of them considered culprits and thus effectively deserving of\\nthe suffering the pandemic will inflict upon them. Lost entirely is the fact that the elderly are\\nindividual human beings, each with a distinctive face and voice, each with hopes and\\ndreams, memories and regrets, friendships and marriages, loves lost and loves sustained.\\n‘The elderly’ have become another dehumanised group for which\\nanything goes and for many that has resulted in cold disregard for\\ntheir rights and their life. The distinctive face that Held talks about is\\ndesigned to be deleted by masks until everyone is part of a faceless\\nmass. ‘War-zone’ hospitals myth\\nAgain and again medical professionals have told me what was really\\ngoing on and how hospitals ‘overrun like war zones’ according to\\nthe media were virtually empty. The mantra from medical\\nwhistleblowers was please don’t use my name or my career is over.\\nCitizen journalists around the world sneaked into hospitals to ﬁlm\\nevidence exposing the ‘war-zone’ lie. They really were largely empty\\nwith closed wards and operating theatres. I met a hospital worker in\\nmy town on the Isle of Wight during the ﬁrst lockdown in 2020 who\\nsaid the only island hospital had never been so quiet. Lockdown was\\njustiﬁed by the psychopaths to stop hospitals being overrun. At the\\nsame time that the island hospital was near-empty the military\\narrived here to provide extra beds. It was all propaganda to ramp up\\nthe fear to ensure compliance with fascism as were never-used\\ntemporary hospitals with thousands of beds known as Nightingales\\nand never-used make-shi\\x00 mortuaries opened by the criminal UK\\ngovernment. A man who helped to install those extra island beds\\na\\x00ributed to the army said they were never used and the hospital\\nwas empty. Doctors and nurses ‘stood around talking or on their\\nphones, wandering down to us to see what we were doing’. There\\nwere no masks or social distancing. He accused the useless local\\nisland paper, the County Press, of ‘pumping the fear as if our hospital\\nwas overrun and we only have one so it should have been’. He\\ndescribed ambulances parked up with crews outside in deck chairs.\\nWhen his brother called an ambulance he was told there was a two-\\nhour backlog which he called ‘bullshit’. An old lady on the island fell\\n‘and was in a bad way’, but a caller who rang for an ambulance was\\ntold the situation wasn’t urgent enough. Ambulance stations were\\nworking under capacity while people would hear ambulances with\\nsirens blaring driving through the streets. When those living near\\nthe stations realised what was going on they would follow them as\\nthey le\\x00, circulated around an urban area with the sirens going, and\\nthen came back without stopping. All this was to increase levels of\\nfear and the same goes for the ‘ventilator shortage crisis’ that cost\\ntens of millions for hastily produced ventilators never to be used. Ambulance crews that agreed to be exploited in this way for fear\\npropaganda might ﬁnd themselves a mirror. I wish them well with\\nthat. Empty hospitals were the obvious consequence of treatment\\nand diagnoses of non-’Covid’ conditions cancelled and those\\ninvolved handed a death sentence. People have been dying at home\\nfrom undiagnosed and untreated cancer, heart disease and other life-\\nthreatening conditions to allow empty hospitals to deal with a\\n‘pandemic’ that wasn’t happening.\\nDeath of the innocent\\n‘War-zones’ have been laying oﬀ nursing staﬀ, even doctors where\\nthey can. There was no work for them. Lockdown was justiﬁed by\\nsaving lives and protecting the vulnerable they were actually killing\\nwith DNR orders and preventing empty hospitals being ‘overrun’. In\\nBritain the mantra of stay at home to ‘save the NHS’ was everywhere\\nand across the world the same story was being sold when it was all\\nlies. Two California doctors, Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi at\\nAccelerated Urgent Care in Bakersﬁeld, held a news conference in\\nApril, 2020, to say that intensive care units in California were ‘empty,\\nessentially’, with hospitals shu\\x00ing ﬂoors, not treating patients and\\nlaying oﬀ doctors. The California health system was working at\\nminimum capacity ‘ge\\x00ing rid of doctors because we just don’t have\\nthe volume’. They said that people with conditions such as heart\\ndisease and cancer were not coming to hospital out of fear of ‘Covid-\\n19’. Their video was deleted by Susan Wojcicki’s Cult-owned\\nYouTube a\\x00er reaching ﬁve million views. Florida governor Ron\\nDesantis, who rejected the severe lockdowns of other states and is\\nbeing targeted for doing so, said that in March, 2020, every US\\ngovernor was given models claiming they would run out of hospital\\nbeds in days. That was never going to happen and the ‘modellers’\\nknew it. Deceit can be found at every level of the system. Urgent\\nchildren’s operations were cancelled including fracture repairs and\\nbiopsies to spot cancer. Eric Nicholls, a consultant paediatrician, said\\n‘this is obviously concerning and we need to return to normal\\noperating and to increase capacity as soon as possible’. Psychopaths in power were rather less concerned because they are psychopaths.\\nDeletion of urgent care and diagnosis has been happening all over\\nthe world and how many kids and others have died as a result of the\\nactions of these cold and heartless lunatics dictating ‘health’ policy?\\nThe number must be stratospheric. Richard Sullivan, professor of\\ncancer and global health at King’s College London, said people\\nfeared ‘Covid’ more than cancer such was the campaign of fear.\\n‘Years of lost life will be quite dramatic’, Sullivan said, with ‘a huge\\namount of avoidable mortality’. Sarah Woolnough, executive\\ndirector for policy at Cancer Research UK, said there had been a 75\\npercent drop in urgent referrals to hospitals by family doctors of\\npeople with suspected cancer. Sullivan said that ‘a lot of services\\nhave had to scale back – we’ve seen a dramatic decrease in the\\namount of elective cancer surgery’. Lockdown deaths worldwide has\\nbeen absolutely fantastic with the New York Post reporting how data\\nconﬁrmed that ‘lockdowns end more lives than they save’:\\nThere was a sharp decline in visits to emergency rooms and an increase in fatal heart attacks\\nbecause patients didn’t receive prompt treatment. Many fewer people were screened for\\ncancer. Social isolation contributed to excess deaths from dementia and Alzheimer’s.\\nResearchers predicted that the social and economic upheaval would lead to tens of thousands\\nof “deaths of despair” from drug overdoses, alcoholism and suicide. As unemployment surged\\nand mental-health and substance-abuse treatment programs were interrupted, the reported\\nlevels of anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts increased dramatically, as did alcohol sales\\nand fatal drug overdoses.\\nThis has been happening while nurses and other staﬀ had so much\\ntime on their hands in the ‘war-zones’ that Tic-Tok dancing videos\\nbegan appearing across the Internet with medical staﬀ dancing\\naround in empty wards and corridors as people died at home from\\ncauses that would normally have been treated in hospital.\\nMentions in dispatches\\nOne brave and truth-commi\\x00ed whistleblower was Louise\\nHampton, a call handler with the UK NHS who made a viral\\nInternet video saying she had done ‘fuck all’ during the ‘pandemic’ which was ‘a load of bollocks’. She said that ‘Covid-19’ was\\nrebranded ﬂu and of course she lost her job. This is what happens in\\nthe medical and endless other professions now when you tell the\\ntruth. Louise ﬁlmed inside ‘war-zone’ accident and emergency\\ndepartments to show they were empty and I mean empty as in no\\none there. The mainstream media could have done the same and\\nblown the gaﬀ on the whole conspiracy. They haven’t to their eternal\\nshame. Not that most ‘journalists’ seem capable of manifesting\\nshame as with the psychopaths they slavishly repeat without\\nquestion. The relative few who were admi\\x00ed with serious health\\nproblems were le\\x00 to die alone with no loved ones allowed to see\\nthem because of ‘Covid’ rules and they included kids dying without\\nthe comfort of mum and dad at their bedside while the evil behind\\nthis couldn’t give a damn. It was all good fun to them. A Sco\\x00ish\\nNHS staﬀ nurse publicly quit in the spring of 2021 saying: ‘I can no\\nlonger be part of the lies and the corruption by the government.’ She\\nsaid hospitals ‘aren’t full, the beds aren’t full, beds have been shut,\\nwards have been shut’. Hospitals were never busy throughout\\n‘Covid’. The staﬀ nurse said that Nicola Sturgeon, tragically the\\nleader of the Sco\\x00ish government, was on television saying save the\\nhospitals and the NHS – ‘but the beds are empty’ and ‘we’ve not\\nseen ﬂu, we always see ﬂu every year’. She wrote to government and\\nspoke with her union Unison (the unions are Cult-compromised and\\nuseless, but nothing changed. Many of her colleagues were scared of\\nlosing their jobs if they spoke out as they wanted to. She said\\nnursing staﬀ were being aﬀected by wearing masks all day and ‘my\\nhead is spli\\x00ing every shi\\x00 from wearing a mask’. The NHS is part\\nof the fascist tyranny and must be dismantled so we can start again\\nwith human beings in charge. (Ironically, hospitals were reported to\\nbe busier again when oﬃcial ‘Covid’ cases fell in spring/summer of\\n2021 and many other conditions required treatment at the same time\\nas the fake vaccine rollout.)\\nI will cover the ‘Covid vaccine’ scam in detail later, but it is\\nanother indicator of the sickening disregard for human life that I am\\nhighlighting here. The DNA-manipulating concoctions do not fulﬁl the deﬁnition of a ‘vaccine’, have never been used on humans before\\nand were given only emergency approval because trials were not\\ncompleted and they continued using the unknowing public. The\\nresult was what a NHS senior nurse with responsibility for ‘vaccine’\\nprocedure said was ‘genocide’. She said the ‘vaccines’ were not\\n‘vaccines’. They had not been shown to be safe and claims about\\ntheir eﬀectiveness by drug companies were ‘poetic licence’. She\\ndescribed what was happening as a ‘horrid act of human\\nannihilation’. The nurse said that management had instigated a\\npolicy of not providing a Patient Information Leaﬂet (PIL) before\\npeople were ‘vaccinated’ even though health care professionals are\\nsupposed to do this according to protocol. Patients should also be\\ntold that they are taking part in an ongoing clinical trial. Her\\nchallenges to what is happening had seen her excluded from\\nmeetings and ridiculed in others. She said she was told to ‘watch my\\nstep … or I would ﬁnd myself surplus to requirements’. The nurse,\\nwho spoke anonymously in fear of her career, said she asked her\\nNHS manager why he/she was content with taking part in genocide\\nagainst those having the ‘vaccines’. The reply was that everyone had\\nto play their part and to ‘put up, shut up, and get it done’.\\nGovernment was ‘leaning heavily’ on NHS management which was\\nclearly leaning heavily on staﬀ. This is how the global ‘medical’\\nhierarchy operates and it starts with the Cult and its World Health\\nOrganization.\\nShe told the story of a doctor who had the Pﬁzer jab and when\\nquestioned had no idea what was in it. The doctor had never read\\nthe literature. We have to stop treating doctors as intellectual giants\\nwhen so many are moral and medical pygmies. The doctor did not\\neven know that the ‘vaccines’ were not fully approved or that their\\ntrials were ongoing. They were, however, asking their patients if\\nthey minded taking part in follow-ups for research purposes – yes,\\nthe ongoing clinical trial. The nurse said the doctor’s ignorance was\\nnot rare and she had spoken to a hospital consultant who had the jab\\nwithout any idea of the background or that the ‘trials’ had not been\\ncompleted. Nurses and pharmacists had shown the same ignorance. ‘My NHS colleagues have forsaken their duty of care, broken their\\ncode of conduct – Hippocratic Oath – and have been brainwashed\\njust the same as the majority of the UK public through propaganda\\n…’ She said she had not been able to recruit a single NHS colleague,\\ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist to stand with her and speak out. Her\\nunion had refused to help. She said that if the genocide came to light\\nshe would not hesitate to give evidence at a Nuremberg-type trial\\nagainst those in power who could have aﬀected the outcomes but\\ndidn’t.\\nAnd all for what?\\nTo put the nonsense into perspective let’s say the ‘virus’ does exist\\nand let’s go completely crazy and accept that the oﬃcial\\nmanipulated ﬁgures for cases and deaths are accurate. Even then a\\nstudy by Stanford University epidemiologist Dr John Ioannidis\\npublished on the World Health Organization website produced an\\naverage infection to fatality rate of … 0.23 percent! Ioannidis said: ‘If\\none could sample equally from all locations globally, the median\\ninfection fatality rate might even be substantially lower than the\\n0.23% observed in my analysis.’ For healthy people under 70 it was\\n… 0.05 percent! This compares with the 3.4 percent claimed by the\\nCult-owned World Health Organization when the hoax was ﬁrst\\nplayed and maximum fear needed to be generated. An updated\\nStanford study in April, 2021, put the ‘infection’ to ‘fatality’ rate at\\njust 0.15 percent. Another team of scientists led by Megan O’Driscoll\\nand Henrik Salje studied data from 45 countries and published their\\nﬁndings on the Nature website. For children and young people the\\nﬁgure is so small it virtually does not register although authorities\\nwill be hyping dangers to the young when they introduce DNA-\\nmanipulating ‘vaccines’ for children. The O’Driscoll study produced\\nan average infection-fatality ﬁgure of 0.003 for children from birth to\\nfour; 0.001 for 5 to 14; 0.003 for 15 to 19; and it was still only 0.456 up\\nto 64. To claim that children must be ‘vaccinated’ to protect them\\nfrom ‘Covid’ is an obvious lie and so there must be another reason\\nand there is. What’s more the average age of a ‘Covid’ death is akin to the average age that people die in general. The average age of\\ndeath in England is about 80 for men and 83 for women. The average\\nage of death from alleged ‘Covid’ is between 82 and 83. California\\ndoctors, Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi, said at their April media\\nconference that projection models of millions of deaths had been\\n‘woefully inaccurate’. They produced detailed ﬁgures showing that\\nCalifornians had a 0.03 chance of dying from ‘Covid’ based on the\\nnumber of people who tested positive (with a test not testing for the\\n‘virus’). Erickson said there was a 0.1 percent chance of dying from\\n‘Covid’ in the state of New York, not just the city, and a 0.05 percent\\nchance in Spain, a centre of ‘Covid-19’ hysteria at one stage. The\\nStanford studies supported the doctors’ data with fatality rate\\nestimates of 0.23 and 0.15 percent. How close are these ﬁgures to my\\nestimate of zero? Death-rate ﬁgures claimed by the World Health\\nOrganization at the start of the hoax were some 15 times higher. The\\nCalifornia doctors said there was no justiﬁcation for lockdowns and\\nthe economic devastation they caused. Everything they had ever\\nlearned about quarantine was that you quarantine the sick and not\\nthe healthy. They had never seen this before and it made no medical\\nsense.\\nWhy in the in the light of all this would governments and medical\\nsystems the world over say that billions must go under house arrest;\\nlose their livelihood; in many cases lose their mind, their health and\\ntheir life; force people to wear masks dangerous to health and\\npsychology; make human interaction and even family interaction a\\ncriminal oﬀence; ban travel; close restaurants, bars, watching live\\nsport, concerts, theatre, and any activity involving human\\ntogetherness and discourse; and closing schools to isolate children\\nfrom their friends and cause many to commit suicide in acts of\\nhopelessness and despair? The California doctors said lockdown\\nconsequences included increased child abuse, partner abuse,\\nalcoholism, depression, and other impacts they were seeing every\\nday. Who would do that to the entire human race if not mentally-ill\\npsychopaths of almost unimaginable extremes like Bill Gates? We\\nmust face the reality of what we are dealing with and come out of denial. Fascism and tyranny are made possible only by the target\\npopulation submi\\x00ing and acquiescing to fascism and tyranny. The\\nwhole of human history shows that to be true. Most people naively\\nand unquestioning believed what they were told about a ‘deadly\\nvirus’ and meekly and weakly submi\\x00ed to house arrest. Those who\\ndidn’t believe it – at least in total – still submi\\x00ed in fear of the\\nconsequences of not doing so. For the rest who wouldn’t submit\\ndraconian ﬁnes have been imposed, brutal policing by psychopaths\\nfor psychopaths, and condemnation from the meek and weak who\\ncondemn the Pushbackers on behalf of the very force that has them,\\ntoo, in its gunsights. ‘Pathetic’ does not even begin to suﬃce.\\nBritain’s brainless ‘Health’ Secretary Ma\\x00 Hancock warned anyone\\nlying to border oﬃcials about returning from a list of ‘hotspot’\\ncountries could face a jail sentence of up to ten years which is more\\nthan for racially-aggravated assault, incest and a\\x00empting to have\\nsex with a child under 13. Hancock is a lunatic, but he has the state\\napparatus behind him in a Cult-led chain reaction and the same with\\nUK ‘Vaccine Minister’ Nadhim Zahawi, a prominent member of the\\nmega-Cult secret society, Le Cercle, which featured in my earlier\\nbooks. The Cult enforces its will on governments and medical\\nsystems; government and medical systems enforce their will on\\nbusiness and police; business enforces its will on staﬀ who enforce it\\non customers; police enforce the will of the Cult on the population\\nand play their essential part in creating a world of fascist control that\\ntheir own children and grandchildren will have to live in their entire\\nlives. It is a hierarchical pyramid of imposition and acquiescence\\nand, yes indeedy, of clinical insanity.\\nDoes anyone bright enough to read this book have to ask what the\\nanswer is? I think not, but I will reveal it anyway in the fewest of\\nsyllables: Tell the psychos and their moronic lackeys to fuck oﬀ and\\nlet’s get on with our lives. We are many – They are few. I\\nCHAPTER SEVEN\\nWar on your mind\\nOne believes things because one has been conditioned to believe\\nthem\\nAldous Huxley, Brave New World\\nhave described the ‘Covid’ hoax as a ‘Psyop’ and that is true in\\nevery sense and on every level in accordance with the deﬁnition of\\nthat term which is psychological warfare. Break down the ‘Covid\\npandemic’ to the foundation themes and it is psychological warfare\\non the human individual and collective mind.\\nThe same can be said for the entire human belief system involving\\nevery subject you can imagine. Huxley was right in his contention\\nthat people believe what they are conditioned to believe and this\\ncomes from the repetition throughout their lives of the same\\nfalsehoods. They spew from government, corporations, media and\\nendless streams of ‘experts’ telling you what the Cult wants you to\\nbelieve and o\\x00en believing it themselves (although far from always).\\n‘Experts’ are rewarded with ‘prestigious’ jobs and titles and as\\nagents of perceptual programming with regular access to the media.\\nThe Cult has to control the narrative – control information – or they\\nlose control of the vital, crucial, without-which-they-cannot-prevail\\npublic perception of reality. The foundation of that control today is\\nthe Internet made possible by the Defense Advanced Research\\nProjects Agency (DARPA), the incredibly sinister technological arm\\nof the Pentagon. The Internet is the result of military technology. DARPA openly brags about establishing the Internet which has been\\na long-term project to lasso the minds of the global population. I\\nhave said for decades the plan is to control information to such an\\nextreme that eventually no one would see or hear anything that the\\nCult does not approve. We are closing in on that end with ferocious\\ncensorship since the ‘Covid’ hoax began and in my case it started\\nback in the 1990s in terms of books and speaking venues. I had to\\ncreate my own publishing company in 1995 precisely because no one\\nelse would publish my books even then. I think they’re all still\\nrunning.\\nCult Internet\\nTo secure total control of information they needed the Internet in\\nwhich pre-programmed algorithms can seek out ‘unclean’ content\\nfor deletion and even stop it being posted in the ﬁrst place. The Cult\\nhad to dismantle print and non-Internet broadcast media to ensure\\nthe transfer of information to the appropriate-named ‘Web’ – a\\ncritical expression of the Cult web. We’ve seen the ever-quickening\\ndemise of traditional media and control of what is le\\x00 by a tiny\\nnumber of corporations operating worldwide. Independent\\njournalism in the mainstream is already dead and never was that\\nmore obvious than since the turn of 2020. The Cult wants all\\ninformation communicated via the Internet to globally censor and\\nallow the plug to be pulled any time. Lockdowns and forced\\nisolation has meant that communication between people has been\\nthrough electronic means and no longer through face-to-face\\ndiscourse and discussion. Cult psychopaths have targeted the bars,\\nrestaurants, sport, venues and meeting places in general for this\\nreason. None of this is by chance and it’s to stop people gathering in\\nany kind of privacy or number while being able to track and monitor\\nall Internet communications and block them as necessary. Even\\nprivate messages between individuals have been censored by these\\nfascists that control Cult fronts like Facebook, Twi\\x00er, Google and\\nYouTube which are all oﬃcially run by Sabbatian place-people and\\nfrom the background by higher-level Sabbatian place people. Facebook, Google, Amazon and their like were seed-funded and\\nsupported into existence with money-no-object infusions of funds\\neither directly or indirectly from DARPA and CIA technology arm\\nIn-Q-Tel. The Cult plays the long game and prepares very carefully\\nfor big plays like ‘Covid’. Amazon is another front in the\\npsychological war and pre\\x00y much controls the global market in\\nbook sales and increasingly publishing. Amazon’s limitless funds\\nhave deleted fantastic numbers of independent publishers to seize\\nglobal domination on the way to deciding which books can be sold\\nand circulated and which cannot. Moves in that direction are already\\nhappening. Amazon’s leading light Jeﬀ Bezos is the grandson of\\nLawrence Preston Gise who worked with DARPA predecessor\\nARPA. Amazon has big connections to the CIA and the Pentagon.\\nThe plan I have long described went like this:\\n1. Employ military technology to establish the Internet.\\n2. Sell the Internet as a place where people can freely communicate without censorship and\\nallow that to happen until the Net becomes the central and irreversible pillar of human\\nsociety. If the Internet had been highly censored from the start many would have rejected it.\\n3. Fund and manipulate major corporations into being to control the circulation of\\ninformation on your Internet using cover stories about geeks in garages to explain how they\\ncame about. Give them unlimited funds to expand rapidly with no need to make a proﬁt for\\nyears while non-Cult companies who need to balance the books cannot compete. You know\\nthat in these circumstances your Googles, YouTubes, Facebooks and Amazons are going to\\nsecure near monopolies by either crushing or buying up the opposition.\\n4. Allow freedom of expression on both the Internet and communication platforms to draw\\npeople in until the Internet is the central and irreversible pillar of human society and your\\ncommunication corporations have reached a stage of near monopoly domination.\\n5. Then unleash your always-planned frenzy of censorship on the basis of ‘where else are\\nyou going to go?’ and continue to expand that until nothing remains that the Cult does not\\nwant its human targets to see.\\nThe process was timed to hit the ‘Covid’ hoax to ensure the best\\nchance possible of controlling the narrative which they knew they\\nhad to do at all costs. They were, a\\x00er all, about to unleash a ‘deadly\\nvirus’ that didn’t really exist. If you do that in an environment of\\nfree-ﬂowing information and opinion you would be dead in the water before you could say Gates is a psychopath. The network was\\nin place through which the Cult-created-and-owned World Health\\nOrganization could dictate the ‘Covid’ narrative and response policy\\nslavishly supported by Cult-owned Internet communication giants\\nand mainstream media while those telling a diﬀerent story were\\ncensored. Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twi\\x00er openly\\nannounced that they would do this. What else would we expect from\\nCult-owned operations like Facebook which former executives have\\nconﬁrmed set out to make the platform more addictive than\\ncigare\\x00es and coldly manipulates emotions of its users to sow\\ndivision between people and groups and scramble the minds of the\\nyoung? If Zuckerberg lives out the rest of his life without going to\\njail for crimes against humanity, and most emphatically against the\\nyoung, it will be a travesty of justice. Still, no ma\\x00er, cause and eﬀect\\nwill catch up with him eventually and the same with Sergey Brin\\nand Larry Page at Google with its CEO Sundar Pichai who ﬁx the\\nGoogle search results to promote Cult narratives and hide the\\nopposition. Put the same key words into Google and other search\\nengines like DuckDuckGo and you will see how diﬀerent results can\\nbe. Wikipedia is another intensely biased ‘encyclopaedia’ which\\nskews its content to the Cult agenda. YouTube links to Wikipedia’s\\nversion of ‘Covid’ and ‘climate change’ on video pages in which\\nexperts in their ﬁeld oﬀer a diﬀerent opinion (even that is\\nincreasingly rare with Wojcicki censorship). Into this ‘Covid’ silence-\\nthem network must be added government media censors, sorry\\n‘regulators’, such as Ofcom in the UK which imposed tyrannical\\nrestrictions on British broadcasters that had the eﬀect of banning me\\nfrom ever appearing. Just to debate with me about my evidence and\\nviews on ‘Covid’ would mean breaking the fascistic impositions of\\nOfcom and its CEO career government bureaucrat Melanie Dawes.\\nGutless British broadcasters tremble at the very thought of fascist\\nOfcom.\\nPsychos behind ‘Covid’ The reason for the ‘Covid’ catastrophe in all its facets and forms can\\nbe seen by whom and what is driving the policies worldwide in such\\na coordinated way. Decisions are not being made to protect health,\\nbut to target psychology. The dominant group guiding and\\n‘advising’ government policy are not medical professionals. They are\\npsychologists and behavioural scientists. Every major country has its\\nown version of this phenomenon and I’ll use the British example to\\nshow how it works. In many ways the British version has been\\naﬀecting the wider world in the form of the huge behaviour\\nmanipulation network in the UK which operates in other countries.\\nThe network involves private companies, government, intelligence\\nand military. The Cabinet Oﬃce is at the centre of the government\\n‘Covid’ Psyop and part-owns, with ‘innovation charity’ Nesta, the\\nBehavioural Insights Team (BIT) which claims to be independent of\\ngovernment but patently isn’t. The BIT was established in 2010 and\\nits job is to manipulate the psyche of the population to acquiesce to\\ngovernment demands and so much more. It is also known as the\\n‘Nudge Unit’, a name inspired by the 2009 book by two ultra-\\nZionists, Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, called Nudge: Improving\\nDecisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness. The book, as with the\\nBehavioural Insights Team, seeks to ‘nudge’ behaviour (manipulate\\nit) to make the public follow pa\\x00erns of action and perception that\\nsuit those in authority (the Cult). Sunstein is so skilled at this that he\\nadvises the World Health Organization and the UK Behavioural\\nInsights Team and was Administrator of the White House Oﬃce of\\nInformation and Regulatory Aﬀairs in the Obama administration.\\nBiden appointed him to the Department of Homeland Security –\\nanother ultra-Zionist in the fold to oversee new immigration laws\\nwhich is another policy the Cult wants to control. Sunstein is\\ndesperate to silence anyone exposing conspiracies and co-authored a\\n2008 report on the subject in which suggestions were oﬀered to ban\\n‘conspiracy theorizing’ or impose ‘some kind of tax, ﬁnancial or\\notherwise, on those who disseminate such theories’. I guess a\\npsychiatrist’s chair is out of the question? Sunstein’s mate Richard Thaler, an ‘academic aﬃliate’ of the UK\\nBehavioural Insights Team, is a proponent of ‘behavioural\\neconomics’ which is deﬁned as the study of ‘the eﬀects of\\npsychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural and social factors on the\\ndecisions of individuals and institutions’. Study the eﬀects so they\\ncan be manipulated to be what you want them to be. Other leading\\nnames in the development of behavioural economics are ultra-\\nZionists Daniel Kahneman and Robert J. Shiller and they, with\\nThaler, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their\\nwork in this ﬁeld. The Behavioural Insights Team is operating at the\\nheart of the UK government and has expanded globally through\\npartnerships with several universities including Harvard, Oxford,\\nCambridge, University College London (UCL) and Pennsylvania.\\nThey claim to have ‘trained’ (reframed) 20,000 civil servants and run\\nmore than 750 projects involving 400 randomised controlled trials in\\ndozens of countries’ as another version of mind reframers Common\\nPurpose. BIT works from its oﬃce in New York with cities and their\\nagencies, as well as other partners, across the United States and\\nCanada – this is a company part-owned by the British government\\nCabinet Oﬃce. An executive order by President Cult-servant Obama\\nestablished a US Social and Behavioral Sciences Team in 2015. They\\nall have the same reason for being and that’s to brainwash the\\npopulation directly and by brainwashing those in positions of\\nauthority.\\n‘Covid’ mind game\\nAnother prime aspect of the UK mind-control network is the\\n‘independent’ [joke] Scientiﬁc Pandemic Insights Group on\\nBehaviours (SPI-B) which ‘provides behavioural science advice\\naimed at anticipating and helping people adhere to interventions\\nthat are recommended by medical or epidemiological experts’. That\\nmeans manipulating public perception and behaviour to do\\nwhatever government tells them to do. It’s disgusting and if they\\nreally want the public to be ‘safe’ this lot should all be under lock\\nand key. According to the government website SPI-B consists of ‘behavioural scientists, health and social psychologists,\\nanthropologists and historians’ and advises the Whi\\x00y-Vallance-led\\nScientiﬁc Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which in turn\\nadvises the government on ‘the science’ (it doesn’t) and ‘Covid’\\npolicy. When politicians say they are being guided by ‘the science’\\nthis is the rabble in each country they are talking about and that\\n‘science’ is dominated by behaviour manipulators to enforce\\ngovernment fascism through public compliance. The Behaviour\\nInsight Team is headed by psychologist David Solomon Halpern, a\\nvisiting professor at King’s College London, and connects with a\\nnational and global web of other civilian and military organisations\\nas the Cult moves towards its goal of fusing them into one fascistic\\nwhole in every country through its ‘Fusion Doctrine’. The behaviour\\nmanipulation network involves, but is not conﬁned to, the Foreign\\nOﬃce; National Security Council; government communications\\nheadquarters (GCHQ); MI5; MI6; the Cabinet Oﬃce-based Media\\nMonitoring Unit; and the Rapid Response Unit which ‘monitors\\ndigital trends to spot emerging issues; including misinformation and\\ndisinformation; and identiﬁes the best way to respond’.\\nThere is also the 77th Brigade of the UK military which operates\\nlike the notorious Israeli military’s Unit 8200 in manipulating\\ninformation and discussion on the Internet by posing as members of\\nthe public to promote the narrative and discredit those who\\nchallenge it. Here we have the military seeking to manipulate\\ndomestic public opinion while the Nazis in government are ﬁne with\\nthat. Conservative Member of Parliament Tobias Ellwood, an\\nadvocate of lockdown and control through ‘vaccine passports’, is a\\nLieutenant Colonel reservist in the 77th Brigade which connects with\\nthe military operation jHub, the ‘innovation centre’ for the Ministry\\nof Defence and Strategic Command. jHub has also been involved\\nwith the civilian National Health Service (NHS) in ‘symptom\\ntracing’ the population. The NHS is a key part of this mind control\\nnetwork and produced a document in December, 2020, explaining to\\nstaﬀ how to use psychological manipulation with diﬀerent groups\\nand ages to get them to have the DNA-manipulating ‘Covid vaccine’ that’s designed to cumulatively rewrite human genetics. The\\ndocument, called ‘Optimising Vaccination Roll Out – Do’s and Dont’s\\nfor all messaging, documents and “communications” in the widest\\nsense’, was published by NHS England and the NHS Improvement\\nBehaviour Change Unit in partnership with Public Health England\\nand Warwick Business School. I hear the mantra about ‘save the\\nNHS’ and ‘protect the NHS’ when we need to scrap the NHS and\\nstart again. The current version is far too corrupt, far too anti-human\\nand totally compromised by Cult operatives and their assets. UK\\ngovernment broadcast media censor Ofcom will connect into this\\nweb – as will the BBC with its tremendous Ofcom inﬂuence – to\\ncontrol what the public see and hear and dictate mass perception.\\nNuremberg trials must include personnel from all these\\norganisations.\\nThe fear factor\\nThe ‘Covid’ hoax has led to the creation of the UK Cabinet Oﬃce-\\nconnected Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) which is oﬃcially described\\nas providing ‘expert advice on pandemics’ using its independent [all\\nCult operations are ‘independent’] analytical function to provide\\nreal-time analysis about infection outbreaks to identify and respond\\nto outbreaks of Covid-19’. Another role is to advise the government\\non a response to spikes in infections – ‘for example by closing\\nschools or workplaces in local areas where infection levels have\\nrisen’. Put another way, promoting the Cult agenda. The Joint\\nBiosecurity Centre is modelled on the Joint Terrorism Analysis\\nCentre which analyses intelligence to set ‘terrorism threat levels’ and\\nhere again you see the fusion of civilian and military operations and\\nintelligence that has led to military intelligence producing\\ndocuments about ‘vaccine hesitancy’ and how it can be combated.\\nDomestic civilian ma\\x00ers and opinions should not be the business of\\nthe military. The Joint Biosecurity Centre is headed by Tom Hurd,\\ndirector general of the Oﬃce for Security and Counter-Terrorism\\nfrom the establishment-to-its-ﬁngertips Hurd family. His father is\\nformer Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. How coincidental that Tom •\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nHurd went to the elite Eton College and Oxford University with\\nBoris Johnson. Imperial College with its ridiculous computer\\nmodeller Neil Ferguson will connect with this gigantic web that will\\nitself interconnect with similar set-ups in other major and not so\\nmajor countries. Compared with this Cult network the politicians, be\\nthey Boris Johnson, Donald Trump or Joe Biden, are bit-part players\\n‘following the science’. The network of psychologists was on the\\n‘Covid’ case from the start with the aim of generating maximum fear\\nof the ‘virus’ to ensure compliance by the population. A government\\nbehavioural science group known as SPI-B produced a paper in\\nMarch, 2020, for discussion by the main government science\\nadvisory group known as SAGE. It was headed ‘Options for\\nincreasing adherence to social distancing measures’ and it said the\\nfollowing in a section headed ‘Persuasion’:\\nA substantial number of people still do not feel suﬃciently\\npersonally threatened; it could be that they are reassured by the\\nlow death rate in their demographic group, although levels of\\nconcern may be rising. Having a good understanding of the risk\\nhas been found to be positively associated with adoption of\\nCOVID-19 social distancing measures in Hong Kong.\\nThe perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased\\namong those who are complacent, using hard-hi\\x00ing evaluation\\nof options for increasing social distancing emotional messaging.\\nTo be eﬀective this must also empower people by making clear\\nthe actions they can take to reduce the threat.\\nResponsibility to others: There seems to be insuﬃcient\\nunderstanding of, or feelings of responsibility about, people’s role\\nin transmi\\x00ing the infection to others … Messaging about actions\\nneed to be framed positively in terms of protecting oneself and\\nthe community, and increase conﬁdence that they will be eﬀective.\\nSome people will be more persuaded by appeals to play by the\\nrules, some by duty to the community, and some to personal risk. All these diﬀerent approaches are needed. The messaging also\\nneeds to take account of the realities of diﬀerent people’s lives.\\nMessaging needs to take account of the diﬀerent motivational\\nlevers and circumstances of diﬀerent people.\\nAll this could be achieved the SPI-B psychologists said by using the\\nmedia to increase the sense of personal threat which translates as terrify\\nthe shit out of the population, including children, so they all do what\\nwe want. That’s not happened has it? Those excuses for ‘journalists’\\nwho wouldn’t know journalism if it bit them on the arse (the great\\nmajority) have played their crucial part in serving this Cult-\\ngovernment Psyop to enslave their own kids and grandkids. How\\nthey live with themselves I have no idea. The psychological war has\\nbeen underpinned by constant government ‘Covid’ propaganda in\\nalmost every television and radio ad break, plus the Internet and\\nprint media, which has pounded out the fear with taxpayers footing\\nthe bill for their own programming. The result has been people\\nterriﬁed of a ‘virus’ that doesn’t exist or one with a tiny fatality rate\\neven if you believe it does. People walk down the street and around\\nthe shops wearing face-nappies damaging their health and\\npsychology while others report those who refuse to be that naïve to\\nthe police who turn up in their own face-nappies. I had a cameraman\\ncome to my ﬂat and he was so frightened of ‘Covid’ he came in\\nwearing a mask and refused to shake my hand in case he caught\\nsomething. He had – naïveitis – and the thought that he worked in\\nthe mainstream media was both depressing and made his behaviour\\nperfectly explainable. The fear which has gripped the minds of so\\nmany and frozen them into compliance has been carefully cultivated\\nby these psychologists who are really psychopaths. If lives get\\ndestroyed and a lot of young people commit suicide it shows our\\nplan is working. SPI-B then turned to compulsion on the public to\\ncomply. ‘With adequate preparation, rapid change can be achieved’,\\nit said. Some countries had introduced mandatory self-isolation on a\\nwide scale without evidence of major public unrest and a large\\nmajority of the UK’s population appeared to be supportive of more\\ncoercive measures with 64 percent of adults saying they would support pu\\x00ing London under a lockdown (watch the ‘polls’ which\\nare designed to make people believe that public opinion is in favour\\nor against whatever the subject in hand).\\nFor ‘aggressive protective measures’ to be eﬀective, the SPI-B\\npaper said, special a\\x00ention should be devoted to those population\\ngroups that are more at risk. Translated from the Orwellian this\\nmeans making the rest of population feel guilty for not protecting\\nthe ‘vulnerable’ such as old people which the Cult and its agencies\\nwere about to kill on an industrial scale with lockdown, lack of\\ntreatment and the Gates ‘vaccine’. Psychopath psychologists sold\\ntheir guilt-trip so comprehensively that Los Angeles County\\nSupervisor Hilda Solis reported that children were apologising (from\\na distance) to their parents and grandparents for bringing ‘Covid’\\ninto their homes and ge\\x00ing them sick. ‘… These apologies are just\\nsome of the last words that loved ones will ever hear as they die\\nalone,’ she said. Gut-wrenchingly Solis then used this childhood\\ntragedy to tell children to stay at home and ‘keep your loved ones\\nalive’. Imagine heaping such potentially life-long guilt on a kid when\\nit has absolutely nothing to do with them. These people are deeply\\ndisturbed and the psychologists behind this even more so.\\nUncivil war – divide and rule\\nProfessional mind-controllers at SPI-B wanted the media to increase\\na sense of responsibility to others (do as you’re told) and promote\\n‘positive messaging’ for those actions while in contrast to invoke\\n‘social disapproval’ by the unquestioning, obedient, community of\\nanyone with a mind of their own. Again the compliant Goebbels-like\\nmedia obliged. This is an old, old, trick employed by tyrannies the\\nworld over throughout human history. You get the target population\\nto keep the target population in line – your line. SPI-B said this could\\n‘play an important role in preventing anti-social behaviour or\\ndiscouraging failure to enact pro-social behaviour’. For ‘anti-social’\\nin the Orwellian parlance of SPI-B see any behaviour that\\ngovernment doesn’t approve. SPI-B recommendations said that\\n‘social disapproval’ should be accompanied by clear messaging and promotion of strong collective identity – hence the government and\\ncelebrity mantra of ‘we’re all in this together’. Sure we are. The mind\\ndoctors have such contempt for their targets that they think some\\nclueless comedian, actor or singer telling them to do what the\\ngovernment wants will be enough to win them over. We have had\\nUK comedian Lenny Henry, actor Michael Caine and singer Elton\\nJohn wheeled out to serve the propagandists by urging people to\\nhave the DNA-manipulating ‘Covid’ non-’vaccine’. The role of\\nHenry and fellow black celebrities in seeking to coax a ‘vaccine’\\nreluctant black community into doing the government’s will was\\nespecially stomach-turning. An emotion-manipulating script and\\ncarefully edited video featuring these black ‘celebs’ was such an\\ninsult to the intelligence of black people and where’s the self-respect\\nof those involved selling their souls to a fascist government agenda?\\nHenry said he heard black people’s ‘legitimate worries and\\nconcerns’, but people must ‘trust the facts’ when they were doing\\nexactly that by not having the ‘vaccine’. They had to include the\\nobligatory reference to Black Lives Ma\\x00er with the line … ‘Don’t let\\ncoronavirus cost even more black lives – because we ma\\x00er’. My\\ngod, it was pathetic. ‘I know the vaccine is safe and what it does.’\\nHow? ‘I’m a comedian and it says so in my script.’\\nSPI-B said social disapproval needed to be carefully managed to\\navoid victimisation, scapegoating and misdirected criticism, but they\\nknew that their ‘recommendations’ would lead to exactly that and\\nthe media were speciﬁcally used to stir-up the divide-and-conquer\\nhostility. Those who conform like good li\\x00le baa, baas, are praised\\nwhile those who have seen through the tidal wave of lies are\\n‘Covidiots’. The awake have been abused by the fast asleep for not\\nconforming to fascism and impositions that the awake know are\\ndesigned to endanger their health, dehumanise them, and tear\\nasunder the very fabric of human society. We have had the curtain-\\ntwitchers and morons reporting neighbours and others to the face-\\nnappied police for breaking ‘Covid rules’ with fascist police\\ndelighting in posting links and phone numbers where this could be\\ndone. The Cult cannot impose its will without a compliant police and military or a compliant population willing to play their part in\\nenslaving themselves and their kids. The words of a pastor in Nazi\\nGermany are so appropriate today:\\nFirst they came for the socialists and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist.\\nThen they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade\\nunionist.\\nThen they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.\\nThen they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.\\nThose who don’t learn from history are destined to repeat it and so\\nmany are.\\n‘Covid’ rules: Rewiring the mind\\nWith the background laid out to this gigantic national and global\\nweb of psychological manipulation we can put ‘Covid’ rules into a\\nclear and sinister perspective. Forget the claims about protecting\\nhealth. ‘Covid’ rules are about dismantling the human mind,\\nbreaking the human spirit, destroying self-respect, and then pu\\x00ing\\nHumpty Dumpty together again as a servile, submissive slave. Social\\nisolation through lockdown and distancing have devastating eﬀects\\non the human psyche as the psychological psychopaths well know\\nand that’s the real reason for them. Humans need contact with each\\nother, discourse, closeness and touch, or they eventually, and\\nliterarily, go crazy. Masks, which I will address at some length,\\nfundamentally add to the eﬀects of isolation and the Cult agenda to\\ndehumanise and de-individualise the population. To do this while\\nknowing – in fact seeking – this outcome is the very epitome of evil\\nand psychologists involved in this are the epitome of evil. They must\\nlike all the rest of the Cult demons and their assets stand trial for\\ncrimes against humanity on a scale that deﬁes the imagination.\\nPsychopaths in uniform use isolation to break enemy troops and\\nagents and make them subservient and submissive to tell what they\\nknow. The technique is rightly considered a form of torture and torture is most certainly what has been imposed on the human\\npopulation.\\nClinically-insane American psychologist Harry Harlow became\\nfamous for his isolation experiments in the 1950s in which he\\nseparated baby monkeys from their mothers and imprisoned them\\nfor months on end in a metal container or ‘pit of despair’. They soon\\nbegan to show mental distress and depression as any idiot could\\nhave predicted. Harlow put other monkeys in steel chambers for\\nthree, six or twelve months while denying them any contact with\\nanimals or humans. He said that the eﬀects of total social isolation\\nfor six months were ‘so devastating and debilitating that we had\\nassumed initially that twelve months of isolation would not produce\\nany additional decrement’; but twelve months of isolation ‘almost\\nobliterated the animals socially’. This is what the Cult and its\\npsychopaths are doing to you and your children. Even monkeys in\\npartial isolation in which they were not allowed to form\\nrelationships with other monkeys became ‘aggressive and hostile,\\nnot only to others, but also towards their own bodies’. We have seen\\nthis in the young as a consequence of lockdown. UK government\\npsychopaths launched a public relations campaign telling people not\\nto hug each other even a\\x00er they received the ‘Covid-19 vaccine’\\nwhich we were told with more lies would allow a return to ‘normal\\nlife’. A government source told The Telegraph: ‘It will be along the\\nlines that it is great that you have been vaccinated, but if you are\\ngoing to visit your family and hug your grandchildren there is a\\nchance you are going to infect people you love.’ The source was\\napparently speaking from a secure psychiatric facility. Janet Lord,\\ndirector of Birmingham University’s Institute of Inﬂammation and\\nAgeing, said that parents and grandparents should avoid hugging\\ntheir children. Well, how can I put it, Ms Lord? Fuck oﬀ. Yep, that’ll\\ndo.\\nDestroying the kids – where are the parents?\\nObserve what has happened to people enslaved and isolated by\\nlockdown as suicide and self-harm has soared worldwide, particularly among the young denied the freedom to associate with\\ntheir friends. A study of 49,000 people in English-speaking countries\\nconcluded that almost half of young adults are at clinical risk of\\nmental health disorders. A national survey in America of 1,000\\ncurrently enrolled high school and college students found that 5\\npercent reported a\\x00empting suicide during the pandemic. Data from\\nthe US CDC’s National Syndromic Surveillance Program from\\nJanuary 1st to October 17th, 2020, revealed a 31 percent increase in\\nmental health issues among adolescents aged 12 to 17 compared\\nwith 2019. The CDC reported that America in general suﬀered the\\nbiggest drop in life expectancy since World War Two as it fell by a\\nyear in the ﬁrst half of 2020 as a result of ‘deaths of despair’ –\\noverdoses and suicides. Deaths of despair have leapt by more than\\n20 percent during lockdown and include the highest number of fatal\\noverdoses ever recorded in a single year – 81,000. Internet addiction\\nis another consequence of being isolated at home which lowers\\ninterest in physical activities as kids fall into inertia and what’s the\\npoint? Children and young people are losing hope and giving up on\\nlife, sometimes literally. A 14-year-old boy killed himself in\\nMaryland because he had ‘given up’ when his school district didn’t\\nreopen; an 11-year-old boy shot himself during a zoom class; a\\nteenager in Maine succumbed to the isolation of the ‘pandemic’\\nwhen he ended his life a\\x00er experiencing a disrupted senior year at\\nschool. Children as young as nine have taken their life and all these\\nstories can be repeated around the world. Careers are being\\ndestroyed before they start and that includes those in sport in which\\npromising youngsters have not been able to take part. The plan of\\nthe psycho-psychologists is working all right. Researchers at\\nCambridge University found that lockdowns cause signiﬁcant harm\\nto children’s mental health. Their study was published in the\\nArchives of Disease in Childhood, and followed 168 children aged\\nbetween 7 and 11. The researchers concluded:\\nDuring the UK lockdown, children’s depression symptoms have increased substantially,\\nrelative to before lockdown. The scale of this effect has direct relevance for the continuation\\nof different elements of lockdown policy, such as complete or partial school closures … … Specifically, we observed a statistically significant increase in ratings of depression, with a\\nmedium-to-large effect size. Our findings emphasise the need to incorporate the potential\\nimpact of lockdown on child mental health in planning the ongoing response to the global\\npandemic and the recovery from it.\\nNot a chance when the Cult’s psycho-psychologists were ge\\x00ing\\nexactly what they wanted. The UK’s Royal College of Paediatrics and\\nChild Health has urged parents to look for signs of eating disorders\\nin children and young people a\\x00er a three to four fold increase.\\nSpecialists say the ‘pandemic’ is a major reason behind the rise. You\\ndon’t say. The College said isolation from friends during school\\nclosures, exam cancellations, loss of extra-curricular activities like\\nsport, and an increased use of social media were all contributory\\nfactors along with fears about the virus (psycho-psychologists\\nagain), family ﬁnances, and students being forced to quarantine.\\nDoctors said young people were becoming severely ill by the time\\nthey were seen with ‘Covid’ regulations reducing face-to-face\\nconsultations. Nor is it only the young that have been devastated by\\nthe psychopaths. Like all bullies and cowards the Cult is targeting\\nthe young, elderly, weak and inﬁrm. A typical story was told by a\\nBritish lady called Lynn Parker who was not allowed to visit her\\nhusband in 2020 for the last ten and half months of his life ‘when he\\nneeded me most’ between March 20th and when he died on\\nDecember 19th. This vacates the criminal and enters the territory of\\nevil. The emotional impact on the immune system alone is immense\\nas are the number of people of all ages worldwide who have died as\\na result of Cult-demanded, Gates-demanded, lockdowns.\\nIsolation is torture\\nThe experience of imposing solitary conﬁnement on millions of\\nprisoners around the world has shown how a large percentage\\nbecome ‘actively psychotic and/or acutely suicidal’. Social isolation\\nhas been found to trigger ‘a speciﬁc psychiatric syndrome,\\ncharacterized by hallucinations; panic a\\x00acks; overt paranoia;\\ndiminished impulse control; hypersensitivity to external stimuli; and\\ndiﬃculties with thinking, concentration and memory’. Juan Mendez, a United Nations rapporteur (investigator), said that isolation is a\\nform of torture. Research has shown that even a\\x00er isolation\\nprisoners ﬁnd it far more diﬃcult to make social connections and I\\nremember cha\\x00ing to a shop assistant a\\x00er one lockdown who told\\nme that when her young son met another child again he had no idea\\nhow to act or what to do. Hannah Flanagan, Director of Emergency\\nServices at Journey Mental Health Center in Dane County,\\nWisconsin, said: ‘The speciﬁcity about Covid social distancing and\\nisolation that we’ve come across as contributing factors to the\\nsuicides are really new to us this year.’ But they are not new to those\\nthat devised them. They are ge\\x00ing the eﬀect they want as the\\npopulation is psychologically dismantled to be rebuilt in a totally\\ndiﬀerent way. Children and the young are particularly targeted.\\nThey will be the adults when the full-on fascist AI-controlled\\ntechnocracy is planned to be imposed and they are being prepared\\nto meekly submit. At the same time older people who still have a\\nmemory of what life was like before – and how fascist the new\\nnormal really is – are being deleted. You are going to see eﬀorts to\\nturn the young against the old to support this geriatric genocide.\\nHannah Flanagan said the big increase in suicide in her county\\nproved that social isolation is not only harmful, but deadly. Studies\\nhave shown that isolation from others is one of the main risk factors\\nin suicide and even more so with women. Warnings that lockdown\\ncould create a ‘perfect storm’ for suicide were ignored. A\\x00er all this\\nwas one of the reasons for lockdown. Suicide, however, is only the\\nmost extreme of isolation consequences. There are many others. Dr\\nDhruv Khullar, assistant professor of healthcare policy at Weill\\nCornell Medical College, said in a New York Times article in 2016 long\\nbefore the fake ‘pandemic’:\\nA wave of new research suggests social separation is bad for us. Individuals with less social\\nconnection have disrupted sleep patterns, altered immune systems, more inflammation and\\nhigher levels of stress hormones. One recent study found that isolation increases the risk of\\nheart disease by 29 percent and stroke by 32 percent. Another analysis that pooled data from\\n70 studies and 3.4 million people found that socially isolated individuals had a 30 percent\\nhigher risk of dying in the next seven years, and that this effect was largest in middle age. Loneliness can accelerate cognitive decline in older adults, and isolated individuals are twice\\nas likely to die prematurely as those with more robust social interactions. These effects start\\nearly: Socially isolated children have significantly poorer health 20 years later, even after\\ncontrolling for other factors. All told, loneliness is as important a risk factor for early death as\\nobesity and smoking.\\nThere you have proof from that one article alone four years before\\n2020 that those who have enforced lockdown, social distancing and\\nisolation knew what the eﬀect would be and that is even more so\\nwith professional psychologists that have been driving the policy\\nacross the globe. We can go back even further to the years 2000 and\\n2003 and the start of a major study on the eﬀects of isolation on\\nhealth by Dr Janine Gronewold and Professor Dirk M. Hermann at\\nthe University Hospital in Essen, Germany, who analysed data on\\n4,316 people with an average age of 59 who were recruited for the\\nlong-term research project. They found that socially isolated people\\nare more than 40 percent more likely to have a heart a\\x00ack, stroke,\\nor other major cardiovascular event and nearly 50 percent more\\nlikely to die from any cause. Given the ﬁnancial Armageddon\\nunleashed by lockdown we should note that the study found a\\nrelationship between increased cardiovascular risk and lack of\\nﬁnancial support. A\\x00er excluding other factors social isolation was\\nstill connected to a 44 percent increased risk of cardiovascular\\nproblems and a 47 percent increased risk of death by any cause. Lack\\nof ﬁnancial support was associated with a 30 percent increase in the\\nrisk of cardiovascular health events. Dr Gronewold said it had been\\nknown for some time that feeling lonely or lacking contact with close\\nfriends and family can have an impact on physical health and the\\nstudy had shown that having strong social relationships is of high\\nimportance for heart health. Gronewold said they didn’t understand\\nyet why people who are socially isolated have such poor health\\noutcomes, but this was obviously a worrying ﬁnding, particularly\\nduring these times of prolonged social distancing. Well, it can be\\nexplained on many levels. You only have to identify the point in the\\nbody where people feel loneliness and missing people they are\\nparted from – it’s in the centre of the chest where they feel the ache\\nof loneliness and the ache of missing people. ‘My heart aches for you’ … ‘My heart aches for some company.’ I will explain this more\\nin the chapter Escaping Wetiko, but when you realise that the body\\nis the mind – they are expressions of each other – the reason why\\nstate of the mind dictates state of the body becomes clear.\\nAmerican psychologist Ranjit Powar was highlighting the eﬀects\\nof lockdown isolation as early as April, 2020. She said humans have\\nevolved to be social creatures and are wired to live in interactive\\ngroups. Being isolated from family, friends and colleagues could be\\nunbalancing and traumatic for most people and could result in short\\nor even long-term psychological and physical health problems. An\\nincrease in levels of anxiety, aggression, depression, forgetfulness\\nand hallucinations were possible psychological eﬀects of isolation.\\n‘Mental conditions may be precipitated for those with underlying\\npre-existing susceptibilities and show up in many others without\\nany pre-condition.’ Powar said personal relationships helped us cope\\nwith stress and if we lost this outlet for le\\x00ing oﬀ steam the result\\ncan be a big emotional void which, for an average person, was\\ndiﬃcult to deal with. ‘Just a few days of isolation can cause\\nincreased levels of anxiety and depression’ – so what the hell has\\nbeen the eﬀect on the global population of 18 months of this at the\\ntime of writing? Powar said: ‘Add to it the looming threat of a\\ndreadful disease being repeatedly hammered in through the media\\nand you have a recipe for many shades of mental and physical\\ndistress.’ For those with a house and a garden it is easy to forget that\\nbillions have had to endure lockdown isolation in tiny overcrowded\\nﬂats and apartments with nowhere to go outside. The psychological\\nand physical consequences of this are unimaginable and with lunatic\\nand abusive partners and parents the consequences have led to\\ntremendous increases in domestic and child abuse and alcoholism as\\npeople seek to shut out the horror. Ranjit Powar said:\\nStaying in a confined space with family is not all a rosy picture for everyone. It can be\\nextremely oppressive and claustrophobic for large low-income families huddled together in\\nsmall single-room houses. Children here are not lucky enough to have many board/electronic\\ngames or books to keep them occupied. Add to it the deep insecurity of running out of funds for food and basic necessities. On the\\nother hand, there are people with dysfunctional family dynamics, such as domineering,\\nabusive or alcoholic partners, siblings or parents which makes staying home a period of trial.\\nIncidence of suicide and physical abuse against women has shown a worldwide increase.\\nHeightened anxiety and depression also affect a person’s immune system, making them more\\nsusceptible to illness.\\nTo think that Powar’s article was published on April 11th, 2020.\\nSix-feet fantasy\\nSocial (unsocial) distancing demanded that people stay six feet or\\ntwo metres apart. UK government advisor Robert Dingwall from the\\nNew and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group said\\nin a radio interview that the two-metre rule was ‘conjured up out of\\nnowhere’ and was not based on science. No, it was not based on\\nmedical science, but it didn’t come out of nowhere. The distance\\nrelated to psychological science. Six feet/two metres was adopted in\\nmany countries and we were told by people like the criminal\\nAnthony Fauci and his ilk that it was founded on science. Many\\nschools could not reopen because they did not have the space for six-\\nfeet distancing. Then in March, 2021, a\\x00er a year of six-feet ‘science’,\\na study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases involving more\\nthan 500,000 students and almost 100,000 staﬀ over 16 weeks\\nrevealed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in ‘Covid’ cases between six feet\\nand three feet and Fauci changed his tune. Now three feet was okay.\\nThere is no diﬀerence between six feet and three inches when there is\\nno ‘virus’ and they got away with six feet for psychological reasons\\nfor as long as they could. I hear journalists and others talk about\\n‘unintended consequences’ of lockdown. They are not unintended at\\nall; they have been coldly-calculated for a speciﬁc outcome of human\\ncontrol and that’s why super-psychopaths like Gates have called for\\nthem so vehemently. Super-psychopath psychologists have\\ndemanded them and psychopathic or clueless, spineless, politicians\\nhave gone along with them by ‘following the science’. But it’s not\\nscience at all. ‘Science’ is not what is; it’s only what people can be\\nmanipulated to believe it is. The whole ‘Covid’ catastrophe is founded on mind control. Three word or three statement mantras\\nissued by the UK government are a well-known mind control\\ntechnique and so we’ve had ‘Stay home/protect the NHS/save lives’,\\n‘Stay alert/control the virus/save lives’ and ‘hands/face/space’. One\\nof the most vocal proponents of extreme ‘Covid’ rules in the UK has\\nbeen Professor Susan Michie, a member of the British Communist\\nParty, who is not a medical professional. Michie is the director of the\\nCentre for Behaviour Change at University College London. She is a\\nbehavioural psychologist and another ﬁlthy rich ‘Marxist’ who praised\\nChina’s draconian lockdown. She was known by fellow students at\\nOxford University as ‘Stalin’s nanny’ for her extreme Marxism.\\nMichie is an inﬂuential member of the UK government’s Scientiﬁc\\nAdvisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and behavioural\\nmanipulation groups which have dominated ‘Covid’ policy. She is a\\nconsultant adviser to the World Health Organization on ‘Covid-19’\\nand behaviour. Why the hell are lockdowns anything to do with her\\nwhen they are claimed to be about health? Why does a behavioural\\npsychologist from a group charged with changing the behaviour of\\nthe public want lockdown, human isolation and mandatory masks?\\nDoes that question really need an answer? Michie absolutely has to\\nexplain herself before a Nuremberg court when humanity takes back\\nits world again and even more so when you see the consequences of\\nmasks that she demands are compulsory. This is a Michie classic:\\nThe benefits of getting primary school children to wear masks is that regardless of what little\\ndegree of transmission is occurring in those age groups it could help normalise the practice.\\nYoung children wearing masks may be more likely to get their families to accept masks.\\nThose words alone should carry a prison sentence when you\\nponder on the callous disregard for children involved and what a\\nstatement it makes about the mind and motivations of Susan Michie.\\nWhat a lovely lady and what she said there encapsulates the\\nmentality of the psychopaths behind the ‘Covid’ horror. Let us\\ncompare what Michie said with a countrywide study in Germany\\npublished at researchsquare.com involving 25,000 school children\\nand 17,854 health complaints submi\\x00ed by parents. Researchers found that masks are harming children physically, psychologically,\\nand behaviourally with 24 health issues associated with mask\\nwearing. They include: shortness of breath (29.7%); dizziness\\n(26.4%); increased headaches (53%); diﬃculty concentrating (50%);\\ndrowsiness or fatigue (37%); and malaise (42%). Nearly a third of\\nchildren experienced more sleep issues than before and a quarter\\ndeveloped new fears. Researchers found health issues and other\\nimpairments in 68 percent of masked children covering their faces\\nfor an average of 4.5 hours a day. Hundreds of those taking part\\nexperienced accelerated respiration, tightness in the chest, weakness,\\nand short-term impairment of consciousness. A reminder of what\\nMichie said again:\\nThe benefits of getting primary school children to wear masks is that regardless of what little\\ndegree of transmission is occurring in those age groups it could help normalise the practice.\\nYoung children wearing masks may be more likely to get their families to accept masks.\\nPsychopaths in government and psychology now have children and\\nyoung people – plus all the adults – wearing masks for hours on end\\nwhile clueless teachers impose the will of the psychopaths on the\\nyoung they should be protecting. What the hell are parents doing?\\nCult lab rats\\nWe have some schools already imposing on students microchipped\\nbuzzers that activate when they get ‘too close’ to their pals in the\\nway they do with lab rats. How apt. To the Cult and its brain-dead\\nservants our children are lab rats being conditioned to be\\nunquestioning, dehumanised slaves for the rest of their lives.\\nChildren and young people are being weaned and frightened away\\nfrom the most natural human instincts including closeness and\\ntouch. I have tracked in the books over the years how schools were\\nbanning pupils from greeting each other with a hug and the whole\\nCult-induced Me Too movement has terriﬁed men and boys from a\\nrelaxed and natural interaction with female friends and work\\ncolleagues to the point where many men try never to be in a room alone with a woman that’s not their partner. Airhead celebrities have\\nas always played their virtue-signalling part in making this happen\\nwith their gross exaggeration. For every monster like Harvey\\nWeinstein there are at least tens of thousands of men that don’t treat\\nwomen like that; but everyone must be branded the same and policy\\nchanged for them as well as the monster. I am going to be using the\\nword ‘dehumanise’ many times in this chapter because that is what\\nthe Cult is seeking to do and it goes very deep as we shall see. Don’t\\nlet them kid you that social distancing is planned to end one day.\\nThat’s not the idea. We are seeing more governments and companies\\nfunding and producing wearable gadgets to keep people apart and\\nthey would not be doing that if this was meant to be short-term. A\\ntech start-up company backed by GCHQ, the British Intelligence and\\nmilitary surveillance headquarters, has created a social distancing\\nwrist sensor that alerts people when they get too close to others. The\\nCIA has also supported tech companies developing similar devices.\\nThe wearable sensor was developed by Tended, one of a number of\\nstart-up companies supported by GCHQ (see the CIA and DARPA).\\nThe device can be worn on the wrist or as a tag on the waistband and\\nwill vibrate whenever someone wearing the device breaches social\\ndistancing and gets anywhere near natural human contact. The\\ncompany had a lucky break in that it was developing a distancing\\nsensor when the ‘Covid’ hoax arrived which immediately provided a\\npotentially enormous market. How fortunate. The government in\\nbig-time Cult-controlled Ontario in Canada is investing $2.5 million\\nin wearable contact tracing technology that ‘will alert users if they\\nmay have been exposed to the Covid-19 in the workplace and will\\nbeep or vibrate if they are within six feet of another person’.\\nFacedrive Inc., the technology company behind this, was founded in\\n2016 with funding from the Ontario Together Fund and obviously\\nthey, too, had a prophet on the board of directors. The human\\nsurveillance and control technology is called TraceSCAN and would\\nbe worn by the human cyborgs in places such as airports,\\nworkplaces, construction sites, care homes and … schools. I emphasise schools with children and young people the prime\\ntargets. You know what is planned for society as a whole if you keep\\nyour eyes on the schools. They have always been places where the\\nstate program the next generation of slaves to be its compliant\\nworker-ants – or Woker-ants these days; but in the mist of the\\n‘Covid’ madness they have been transformed into mind laboratories\\non a scale never seen before. Teachers and head teachers are just as\\nprogrammed as the kids – o\\x00en more so. Children are kept apart\\nfrom human interaction by walk lanes, classroom distancing,\\nstaggered meal times, masks, and the rolling-out of buzzer systems.\\nSchools are now physically laid out as a laboratory maze for lab-rats.\\nLunatics at a school in Anchorage, Alaska, who should be\\nprosecuted for child abuse, took away desks and forced children to\\nkneel (know your place) on a mat for ﬁve hours a day while wearing\\na mask and using their chairs as a desk. How this was supposed to\\nimpact on a ‘virus’ only these clinically insane people can tell you\\nand even then it would be clap-trap. The school banned recess\\n(interaction), art classes (creativity), and physical exercise (ge\\x00ing\\nbody and mind moving out of inertia). Everyone behind this outrage\\nshould be in jail or be\\x00er still a mental institution. The behavioural\\nmanipulators are all for this dystopian approach to schools.\\nProfessor Susan Michie, the mind-doctor and British Communist\\nParty member, said it was wrong to say that schools were safe. They\\nhad to be made so by ‘distancing’, masks and ventilation (si\\x00ing all\\nday in the cold). I must ask this lady round for dinner on a night I\\nknow I am going to be out and not back for weeks. She probably\\nwouldn’t be able to make it, anyway, with all the visits to her own\\npsychologist she must have block-booked.\\nMasking identity\\nI know how shocking it must be for you that a behaviour\\nmanipulator like Michie wants everyone to wear masks which have\\nlong been a feature of mind-control programs like the infamous\\nMKUltra in the United States, but, there we are. We live and learn. I\\nspent many years from 1996 to right across the millennium researching mind control in detail on both sides of the Atlantic and\\nelsewhere. I met a large number of mind-control survivors and\\nmany had been held captive in body and mind by MKUltra. MK\\nstands for mind-control, but employs the German spelling in\\ndeference to the Nazis spirited out of Germany at the end of World\\nWar Two by Operation Paperclip in which the US authorities, with\\nhelp from the Vatican, transported Nazi mind-controllers and\\nengineers to America to continue their work. Many of them were\\nbehind the creation of NASA and they included Nazi scientist and\\nSS oﬃcer Wernher von Braun who swapped designing V-2 rockets to\\nbombard London with designing the Saturn V rockets that powered\\nthe NASA moon programme’s Apollo cra\\x00. I think I may have\\nmentioned that the Cult has no borders. Among Paperclip escapees\\nwas Josef Mengele, the Angel of Death in the Nazi concentration\\ncamps where he conducted mind and genetic experiments on\\nchildren o\\x00en using twins to provide a control twin to measure the\\nimpact of his ‘work’ on the other. If you want to observe the Cult\\nmentality in all its extremes of evil then look into the life of Mengele.\\nI have met many people who suﬀered mercilessly under Mengele in\\nthe United States where he operated under the name Dr Greene and\\nbecame a stalwart of MKUltra programming and torture. Among his\\nlocations was the underground facility in the Mojave Desert in\\nCalifornia called the China Lake Naval Weapons Station which is\\nalmost entirely below the surface. My books The Biggest Secret,\\nChildren of the Matrix and The Perception Deception have the detailed\\nbackground to MKUltra.\\nThe best-known MKUltra survivor is American Cathy O’Brien. I\\nﬁrst met her and her late partner Mark Phillips at a conference in\\nColorado in 1996. Mark helped her escape and deprogram from\\ndecades of captivity in an oﬀshoot of MKUltra known as Project\\nMonarch in which ‘sex slaves’ were provided for the rich and\\nfamous including Father George Bush, Dick Cheney and the\\nClintons. Read Cathy and Mark’s book Trance-Formation of America\\nand if you are new to this you will be shocked to the core. I read it in\\n1996 shortly before, with the usual synchronicity of my life, I found myself given a book table at the conference right next to hers.\\nMKUltra never ended despite being very publicly exposed (only a\\nsmall part of it) in the 1970s and continues in other guises. I am still\\nin touch with Cathy. She contacted me during 2020 a\\x00er masks\\nbecame compulsory in many countries to tell me how they were\\nused as part of MKUltra programming. I had been observing ‘Covid\\nregulations’ and the relationship between authority and public for\\nmonths. I saw techniques that I knew were employed on individuals\\nin MKUltra being used on the global population. I had read many\\nbooks and manuals on mind control including one called Silent\\nWeapons for Quiet Wars which came to light in the 1980s and was a\\nguide on how to perceptually program on a mass scale. ‘Silent\\nWeapons’ refers to mind-control. I remembered a line from the\\nmanual as governments, medical authorities and law enforcement\\nagencies have so obviously talked to – or rather at – the adult\\npopulation since the ‘Covid’ hoax began as if they are children. The\\ndocument said:\\nIf a person is spoken to by a T.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve-year-old, then, due to\\nsuggestibility, he will, with a certain probability, respond or react to that suggestion with the\\nuncritical response of a twelve-year-old and will reach in to his economic reservoir and\\ndeliver its energy to buy that product on impulse when he passes it in the store.\\nThat’s why authority has spoken to adults like children since all this\\nbegan.\\nWhy did Michael Jackson wear masks?\\nEvery aspect of the ‘Covid’ narrative has mind-control as its central\\ntheme. Cathy O’Brien wrote an article for davidicke.com about the\\nconnection between masks and mind control. Her daughter Kelly\\nwho I ﬁrst met in the 1990s was born while Cathy was still held\\ncaptive in MKUltra. Kelly was forced to wear a mask as part of her\\nprogramming from the age of two to dehumanise her, target her\\nsense of individuality and reduce the amount of oxygen her brain\\nand body received. Bingo. This is the real reason for compulsory masks, why they have been enforced en masse, and why they seek to\\nincrease the number they demand you wear. First one, then two,\\nwith one disgraceful alleged ‘doctor’ recommending four which is\\nnothing less than a death sentence. Where and how o\\x00en they must\\nbe worn is being expanded for the purpose of mass mind control\\nand damaging respiratory health which they can call ‘Covid-19’.\\nCanada’s government headed by the man-child Justin Trudeau, says\\nit’s ﬁne for children of two and older to wear masks. An insane\\n‘study’ in Italy involving just 47 children concluded there was no\\nproblem for babies as young as four months wearing them. Even a\\x00er\\npeople were ‘vaccinated’ they were still told to wear masks by the\\ncriminal that is Anthony Fauci. Cathy wrote that mandating masks\\nis allowing the authorities literally to control the air we breathe\\nwhich is what was done in MKUltra. You might recall how the\\nsinger Michael Jackson wore masks and there is a reason for that. He\\nwas subjected to MKUltra mind control through Project Monarch\\nand his psyche was scrambled by these simpletons. Cathy wrote:\\nIn MKUltra Project Monarch mind control, Michael Jackson had to wear a mask to silence his\\nvoice so he could not reach out for help. Remember how he developed that whisper voice\\nwhen he wasn’t singing? Masks control the mind from the outside in, like the redefining of\\nwords is doing. By controlling what we can and cannot say for fear of being labeled racist or\\nbeaten, for example, it ultimately controls thought that drives our words and ultimately actions\\n(or lack thereof).\\nLikewise, a mask muffles our speech so that we are not heard, which controls voice … words\\n… mind. This is Mind Control. Masks are an obvious mind control device, and I am disturbed\\nso many people are complying on a global scale. Masks depersonalize while making a person\\nfeel as though they have no voice. It is a barrier to others. People who would never choose to\\ncomply but are forced to wear a mask in order to keep their job, and ultimately their family\\nfed, are compromised. They often feel shame and are subdued. People have stopped talking\\nwith each other while media controls the narrative.\\nThe ‘no voice’ theme has o\\x00en become literal with train\\npassengers told not to speak to each other in case they pass on the\\n‘virus’, singing banned for the same reason and bonkers California\\noﬃcials telling people riding roller coasters that they cannot shout\\nand scream. Cathy said she heard every day from healed MKUltra\\nsurvivors who cannot wear a mask without ﬂashing back on ways their breathing was controlled – ‘from ball gags and penises to water\\nboarding’. She said that through the years when she saw images of\\npeople in China wearing masks ‘due to pollution’ that it was really\\nto control their oxygen levels. ‘I knew it was as much of a population\\ncontrol mechanism of depersonalisation as are burkas’, she said.\\nMasks are another Chinese communist/fascist method of control that\\nhas been swept across the West as the West becomes China at\\nlightning speed since we entered 2020.\\nMask-19\\nThere are other reasons for mandatory masks and these include\\ndestroying respiratory health to call it ‘Covid-19’ and stunting brain\\ndevelopment of children and the young. Dr Margarite Griesz-\\nBrisson MD, PhD, is a Consultant Neurologist and\\nNeurophysiologist and the Founder and Medical Director of the\\nLondon Neurology and Pain Clinic. Her CV goes down the street\\nand round the corner. She is clearly someone who cares about people\\nand won’t parrot the propaganda. Griesz-Brisson has a PhD in\\npharmacology, with special interest in neurotoxicology,\\nenvironmental medicine, neuroregeneration and neuroplasticity (the\\nway the brain can change in the light of information received). She\\nwent public in October, 2020, with a passionate warning about the\\neﬀects of mask-wearing laws:\\nThe reinhalation of our exhaled air will without a doubt create oxygen deficiency and a\\nflooding of carbon dioxide. We know that the human brain is very sensitive to oxygen\\ndeprivation. There are nerve cells for example in the hippocampus that can’t be longer than 3\\nminutes without oxygen – they cannot survive. The acute warning symptoms are headaches,\\ndrowsiness, dizziness, issues in concentration, slowing down of reaction time – reactions of\\nthe cognitive system.\\nOh, I know, let’s tell bus, truck and taxi drivers to wear them and\\npeople working machinery. How about pilots, doctors and police?\\nGriesz-Brisson makes the important point that while the symptoms\\nshe mentions may fade as the body readjusts this does not alter the\\nfact that people continue to operate in oxygen deﬁcit with long list of potential consequences. She said it was well known that\\nneurodegenerative diseases take years or decades to develop. ‘If\\ntoday you forget your phone number, the breakdown in your brain\\nwould have already started 20 or 30 years ago.’ She said\\ndegenerative processes in your brain are ge\\x00ing ampliﬁed as your\\noxygen deprivation continues through wearing a mask. Nerve cells\\nin the brain are unable to divide themselves normally in these\\ncircumstances and lost nerve cells will no longer be regenerated.\\n‘What is gone is gone.’ Now consider that people like shop workers\\nand schoolchildren are wearing masks for hours every day. What in\\nthe name of sanity is going to be happening to them? ‘I do not wear\\na mask, I need my brain to think’, Griesz-Brisson said, ‘I want to\\nhave a clear head when I deal with my patients and not be in a\\ncarbon dioxide-induced anaesthesia’. If you are told to wear a mask\\nanywhere ask the organisation, police, store, whatever, for their risk\\nassessment on the dangers and negative eﬀects on mind and body of\\nenforcing mask-wearing. They won’t have one because it has never\\nbeen done not even by government. All of them must be subject to\\nclass-action lawsuits as the consequences come to light. They don’t\\ndo mask risk assessments for an obvious reason. They know what\\nthe conclusions would be and independent scientiﬁc studies that\\nhave been done tell a horror story of consequences.\\n‘Masks are criminal’\\nDr Griesz-Brisson said that for children and adolescents, masks are\\nan absolute no-no. They had an extremely active and adaptive\\nimmune system and their brain was incredibly active with so much\\nto learn. ‘The child’s brain, or the youth’s brain, is thirsting for\\noxygen.’ The more metabolically active an organ was, the more\\noxygen it required; and in children and adolescents every organ was\\nmetabolically active. Griesz-Brisson said that to deprive a child’s or\\nadolescent’s brain of oxygen, or to restrict it in any way, was not only\\ndangerous to their health, it was absolutely criminal. ‘Oxygen\\ndeﬁciency inhibits the development of the brain, and the damage\\nthat has taken place as a result CANNOT be reversed.’ Mind manipulators of MKUltra put masks on two-year-olds they wanted\\nto neurologically rewire and you can see why. Griesz-Brisson said a\\nchild needs the brain to learn and the brain needs oxygen to\\nfunction. ‘We don’t need a clinical study for that. This is simple,\\nindisputable physiology.’ Consciously and purposely induced\\noxygen deﬁciency was an absolutely deliberate health hazard, and\\nan absolute medical contraindication which means that ‘this drug,\\nthis therapy, this method or measure should not be used, and is not\\nallowed to be used’. To coerce an entire population to use an\\nabsolute medical contraindication by force, she said, there had to be\\ndeﬁnite and serious reasons and the reasons must be presented to\\ncompetent interdisciplinary and independent bodies to be veriﬁed\\nand authorised. She had this warning of the consequences that were\\ncoming if mask wearing continued:\\nWhen, in ten years, dementia is going to increase exponentially, and the younger generations\\ncouldn’t reach their god-given potential, it won’t help to say ‘we didn’t need the masks’. I\\nknow how damaging oxygen deprivation is for the brain, cardiologists know how damaging it\\nis for the heart, pulmonologists know how damaging it is for the lungs. Oxygen deprivation\\ndamages every single organ. Where are our health departments, our health insurance, our\\nmedical associations? It would have been their duty to be vehemently against the lockdown\\nand to stop it and stop it from the very beginning.\\nWhy do the medical boards issue punishments to doctors who give people exemptions? Does\\nthe person or the doctor seriously have to prove that oxygen deprivation harms people? What\\nkind of medicine are our doctors and medical associations representing? Who is responsible\\nfor this crime? The ones who want to enforce it? The ones who let it happen and play along,\\nor the ones who don’t prevent it?\\nAll of the organisations and people she mentions there either\\nanswer directly to the Cult or do whatever hierarchical levels above\\nthem tell them to do. The outcome of both is the same. ‘It’s not about\\nmasks, it’s not about viruses, it’s certainly not about your health’,\\nGriesz-Brisson said. ‘It is about much, much more. I am not\\nparticipating. I am not afraid.’ They were taking our air to breathe\\nand there was no unfounded medical exemption from face masks.\\nOxygen deprivation was dangerous for every single brain. It had to\\nbe the free decision of every human being whether they want to wear a mask that was absolutely ineﬀective to protect themselves\\nfrom a virus. She ended by rightly identifying where the\\nresponsibility lies for all this:\\nThe imperative of the hour is personal responsibility. We are responsible for what we think,\\nnot the media. We are responsible for what we do, not our superiors. We are responsible for\\nour health, not the World Health Organization. And we are responsible for what happens in\\nour country, not the government.\\nHalle-bloody-lujah.\\nBut surgeons wear masks, right?\\nIndependent studies of mask-wearing have produced a long list of\\nreports detailing mental, emotional and physical dangers. What a\\ndeﬁnition of insanity to see police oﬃcers imposing mask-wearing\\non the public which will cumulatively damage their health while the\\npolice themselves wear masks that will cumulatively damage their\\nhealth. It’s u\\x00er madness and both public and police do this because\\n‘the government says so’ – yes a government of brain-donor idiots\\nlike UK Health Secretary Ma\\x00 Hancock reading the ‘follow the\\nscience’ scripts of psychopathic, lunatic psychologists. The response\\nyou get from Stockholm syndrome suﬀerers defending the very\\nauthorities that are destroying them and their families is that\\n‘surgeons wear masks’. This is considered the game, set and match\\nthat they must work and don’t cause oxygen deﬁcit. Well, actually,\\nscientiﬁc studies have shown that they do and oxygen levels are\\nmonitored in operating theatres to compensate. Surgeons wear\\nmasks to stop spi\\x00le and such like dropping into open wounds – not\\nto stop ‘viral particles’ which are so miniscule they can only be seen\\nthrough an electron microscope. Holes in the masks are signiﬁcantly\\nbigger than ‘viral particles’ and if you sneeze or cough they will\\nbreach the mask. I watched an incredibly disingenuous ‘experiment’\\nthat claimed to prove that masks work in catching ‘virus’ material\\nfrom the mouth and nose. They did this with a slow motion camera\\nand the mask did block big stuﬀ which stayed inside the mask and •\\n•\\n•\\nagainst the face to be breathed in or cause infections on the face as\\nwe have seen with many children. ‘Viral particles’, however, would\\nnever have been picked up by the camera as they came through the\\nmask when they are far too small to be seen. The ‘experiment’ was\\ntherefore disingenuous and useless.\\nStudies have concluded that wearing masks in operating theatres\\n(and thus elsewhere) make no diﬀerence to preventing infection\\nwhile the opposite is true with toxic shite building up in the mask\\nand this had led to an explosion in tooth decay and gum disease\\ndubbed by dentists ‘mask mouth’. You might have seen the Internet\\nvideo of a furious American doctor urging people to take oﬀ their\\nmasks a\\x00er a four-year-old patient had been rushed to hospital the\\nnight before and nearly died with a lung infection that doctors\\nsourced to mask wearing. A study in the journal Cancer Discovery\\nfound that inhalation of harmful microbes can contribute to\\nadvanced stage lung cancer in adults and long-term use of masks\\ncan help breed dangerous pathogens. Microbiologists have said\\nfrequent mask wearing creates a moist environment in which\\nmicrobes can grow and proliferate before entering the lungs. The\\nCanadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, or CADTH,\\na Canadian national organisation that provides research and\\nanalysis to healthcare decision-makers, said this as long ago as 2013\\nin a report entitled ‘Use of Surgical Masks in the Operating Room: A\\nReview of the Clinical Eﬀectiveness and Guidelines’. It said:\\n \\nNo evidence was found to support the use of surgical face masks\\nto reduce the frequency of surgical site infections\\nNo evidence was found on the eﬀectiveness of wearing surgical\\nface masks to protect staﬀ from infectious material in the\\noperating room.\\nGuidelines recommend the use of surgical face masks by staﬀ in\\nthe operating room to protect both operating room staﬀ and\\npatients (despite the lack of evidence). We were told that the world could go back to ‘normal’ with the\\narrival of the ‘vaccines’. When they came, fraudulent as they are, the\\nstory changed as I knew that it would. We are in the midst of\\ntransforming ‘normal’, not going back to it. Mary Ramsay, head of\\nimmunisation at Public Health England, echoed the words of US\\ncriminal Anthony Fauci who said masks and other regulations must\\nstay no ma\\x00er if people are vaccinated. The Fauci idiot continued to\\nwear two masks – diﬀerent colours so both could be clearly seen –\\na\\x00er he claimed to have been vaccinated. Senator Rand Paul told\\nFauci in one exchange that his double-masks were ‘theatre’ and he\\nwas right. It’s all theatre. Mary Ramsay back-tracked on the vaccine-\\nreturn-to-normal theme when she said the public may need to wear\\nmasks and social-distance for years despite the jabs. ‘People have got\\nused to those lower-level restrictions now, and [they] can live with\\nthem’, she said telling us what the idea has been all along. ‘The\\nvaccine does not give you a pass, even if you have had it, you must\\ncontinue to follow all the guidelines’ said a Public Health England\\nstatement which reneged on what we had been told before and\\nmade having the ‘vaccine’ irrelevant to ‘normality’ even by the\\noﬃcial story. Spain’s fascist government trumped everyone by\\npassing a law mandating the wearing of masks on the beach and\\neven when swimming in the sea. The move would have devastated\\nwhat’s le\\x00 of the Spanish tourist industry, posed potential breathing\\ndangers to swimmers and had Northern European sunbathers\\nwalking around with their forehead brown and the rest of their face\\nwhite as a sheet. The ruling was so crazy that it had to be retracted\\na\\x00er pressure from public and tourist industry, but it conﬁrmed\\nwhere the Cult wants to go with masks and how clinically insane\\nauthority has become. The determination to make masks permanent\\nand hide the serious dangers to body and mind can be seen in the\\ncensorship of scientist Professor Denis Rancourt by Bill Gates-\\nfunded academic publishing website ResearchGate over his papers\\nexposing the dangers and uselessness of masks. Rancourt said:\\nResearchGate today has permanently locked my account, which I have had since 2015. Their\\nreasons graphically show the nature of their attack against democracy, and their corruption of science … By their obscene non-logic, a scientific review of science articles reporting on\\nharms caused by face masks has a ‘potential to cause harm’. No criticism of the psychological\\ndevice (face masks) is tolerated, if the said criticism shows potential to influence public policy.\\nThis is what happens in a fascist world.\\nWhere are the ‘greens’ (again)?\\nOther dangers of wearing masks especially regularly relate to the\\ninhalation of minute plastic ﬁbres into the lungs and the deluge of\\ndiscarded masks in the environment and oceans. Estimates\\npredicted that more than 1.5 billion disposable masks will end up in\\nthe world’s oceans every year polluting the water with tons of plastic\\nand endangering marine wildlife. Studies project that humans are\\nusing 129 billion face masks each month worldwide – about three\\nmillion a minute. Most are disposable and made from plastic, non-\\nbiodegradable microﬁbers that break down into smaller plastic\\nparticles that become widespread in ecosystems. They are li\\x00ering\\ncities, clogging sewage channels and turning up in bodies of water. I\\nhave wri\\x00en in other books about the immense amounts of\\nmicroplastics from endless sources now being absorbed into the\\nbody. Rolf Halden, director of the Arizona State University (ASU)\\nBiodesign Center for Environmental Health Engineering, was the\\nsenior researcher in a 2020 study that analysed 47 human tissue\\nsamples and found microplastics in all of them. ‘We have detected\\nthese chemicals of plastics in every single organ that we have\\ninvestigated’, he said. I wrote in The Answer about the world being\\ndeluged with microplastics. A study by the Worldwide Fund for\\nNature (WWF) found that people are consuming on average every\\nweek some 2,000 tiny pieces of plastic mostly through water and also\\nthrough marine life and the air. Every year humans are ingesting\\nenough microplastics to ﬁll a heaped dinner plate and in a life-time\\nof 79 years it is enough to ﬁll two large waste bins. Marco\\nLambertini, WWF International director general said: ‘Not only are\\nplastics polluting our oceans and waterways and killing marine life –\\nit’s in all of us and we can’t escape consuming plastics,’ American geologists found tiny plastic ﬁbres, beads and shards in rainwater\\nsamples collected from the remote slopes of the Rocky Mountain\\nNational Park near Denver, Colorado. Their report was headed: ‘It is\\nraining plastic.’ Rachel Adams, senior lecturer in Biomedical Science\\nat Cardiﬀ Metropolitan University, said that among health\\nconsequences are internal inﬂammation and immune responses to a\\n‘foreign body’. She further pointed out that microplastics become\\ncarriers of toxins including mercury, pesticides and dioxins (a\\nknown cause of cancer and reproductive and developmental\\nproblems). These toxins accumulate in the fa\\x00y tissues once they\\nenter the body through microplastics. Now this is being\\ncompounded massively by people pu\\x00ing plastic on their face and\\nthrowing it away.\\nWorkers exposed to polypropylene plastic ﬁbres known as ‘ﬂock’\\nhave developed ‘ﬂock worker’s lung’ from inhaling small pieces of\\nthe ﬂock ﬁbres which can damage lung tissue, reduce breathing\\ncapacity and exacerbate other respiratory problems. Now …\\ncommonly used surgical masks have three layers of melt-blown\\ntextiles made of … polypropylene. We have billions of people\\npu\\x00ing these microplastics against their mouth, nose and face for\\nhours at a time day a\\x00er day in the form of masks. How does\\nanyone think that will work out? I mean – what could possibly go\\nwrong? We posted a number of scientiﬁc studies on this at\\ndavidicke.com, but when I went back to them as I was writing this\\nbook the links to the science research website where they were\\nhosted were dead. Anything that challenges the oﬃcial narrative in\\nany way is either censored or viliﬁed. The oﬃcial narrative is so\\nunsupportable by the evidence that only deleting the truth can\\nprotect it. A study by Chinese scientists still survived – with the\\nusual twist which it why it was still active, I guess. Yes, they found\\nthat virtually all the masks they tested increased the daily intake of\\nmicroplastic ﬁbres, but people should still wear them because the\\ndanger from the ‘virus’ was worse said the crazy ‘team’ from the\\nInstitute of Hydrobiology in Wuhan. Scientists ﬁrst discovered\\nmicroplastics in lung tissue of some patients who died of lung cancer in the 1990s. Subsequent studies have conﬁrmed the potential health\\ndamage with the plastic degrading slowly and remaining in the\\nlungs to accumulate in volume. Wuhan researchers used a machine\\nsimulating human breathing to establish that masks shed up to\\nnearly 4,000 microplastic ﬁbres in a month with reused masks\\nproducing more. Scientists said some masks are laced with toxic\\nchemicals and a variety of compounds seriously restricted for both\\nhealth and environmental reasons. They include cobalt (used in blue\\ndye) and formaldehyde known to cause watery eyes, burning\\nsensations in the eyes, nose, and throat, plus coughing, wheezing\\nand nausea. No – that must be ‘Covid-19’.\\nMask ‘worms’\\nThere is another and potentially even more sinister content of masks.\\nMostly new masks of diﬀerent makes ﬁlmed under a microscope\\naround the world have been found to contain strange black ﬁbres or\\n‘worms’ that appear to move or ‘crawl’ by themselves and react to\\nheat and water. The nearest I have seen to them are the self-\\nreplicating ﬁbres that are pulled out through the skin of those\\nsuﬀering from Morgellons disease which has been connected to the\\nphenomena of ‘chemtrails’ which I will bring into the story later on.\\nMorgellons ﬁbres continue to grow outside the body and have a\\nform of artiﬁcial intelligence. Black ‘worm’ ﬁbres in masks have that\\nkind of feel to them and there is a nanotechnology technique called\\n‘worm micelles’ which carry and release drugs or anything else you\\nwant to deliver to the body. For sure the suppression of humanity by\\nmind altering drugs is the Cult agenda big time and the more\\nexcuses they can ﬁnd to gain access to the body the more\\nopportunities there are to make that happen whether through\\n‘vaccines’ or masks pushed against the mouth and nose for hours on\\nend.\\nSo let us summarise the pros and cons of masks: Against masks: Breathing in your own carbon dioxide; depriving the\\nbody and brain of suﬃcient oxygen; build-up of toxins in the mask\\nthat can be breathed into the lungs and cause rashes on the face and\\n‘mask-mouth’; breathing microplastic ﬁbres and toxic chemicals into\\nthe lungs; dehumanisation and deleting individualisation by literally\\nmaking people faceless; destroying human emotional interaction\\nthrough facial expression and deleting parental connection with\\ntheir babies which look for guidance to their facial expression.\\nFor masks: They don’t protect you from a ‘virus’ that doesn’t exist\\nand even if it did ‘viral’ particles are so minute they are smaller than\\nthe holes in the mask.\\nGovernments, police, supermarkets, businesses, transport\\ncompanies, and all the rest who seek to impose masks have done no\\nrisk assessment on their consequences for health and psychology\\nand are now open to group lawsuits when the impact becomes clear\\nwith a cumulative epidemic of respiratory and other disease.\\nAuthorities will try to exploit these eﬀects and hide the real cause by\\ndubbing them ‘Covid-19’. Can you imagine se\\x00ing out to force the\\npopulation to wear health-destroying masks without doing any\\nassessment of the risks? It is criminal and it is evil, but then how\\nmany people targeted in this way, who see their children told to\\nwear them all day at school, have asked for a risk assessment?\\nBillions can’t be imposed upon by the few unless the billions allow it.\\nOh, yes, with just a tinge of irony, 85 percent of all masks made\\nworldwide come from China.\\nWash your hands in toxic shite\\n‘Covid’ rules include the use of toxic sanitisers and again the health\\nconsequences of constantly applying toxins to be absorbed through\\nthe skin is obvious to any level of Renegade Mind. America’s Food\\nand Drug Administration (FDA) said that sanitisers are drugs and\\nissued a warning about 75 dangerous brands which contain methanol used in antifreeze and can cause death, kidney damage\\nand blindness. The FDA circulated the following warning even for\\nthose brands that it claims to be safe:\\nStore hand sanitizer out of the reach of pets and children, and children should use it only with\\nadult supervision. Do not drink hand sanitizer. This is particularly important for young\\nchildren, especially toddlers, who may be attracted by the pleasant smell or brightly colored\\nbottles of hand sanitizer.\\nDrinking even a small amount of hand sanitizer can cause alcohol poisoning in children.\\n(However, there is no need to be concerned if your children eat with or lick their hands after\\nusing hand sanitizer.) During this coronavirus pandemic, poison control centers have had an\\nincrease in calls about accidental ingestion of hand sanitizer, so it is important that adults\\nmonitor young children’s use.\\nDo not allow pets to swallow hand sanitizer. If you think your pet has eaten something\\npotentially dangerous, call your veterinarian or a pet poison control center right away. Hand\\nsanitizer is flammable and should be stored away from heat and flames. When using hand\\nsanitizer, rub your hands until they feel completely dry before performing activities that may\\ninvolve heat, sparks, static electricity, or open flames.\\nThere you go, perfectly safe, then, and that’s without even a mention\\nof the toxins absorbed through the skin. Come on kids – sanitise\\nyour hands everywhere you go. It will save you from the ‘virus’. Put\\nall these elements together of the ‘Covid’ normal and see how much\\nhealth and psychology is being cumulatively damaged, even\\ndevastated, to ‘protect your health’. Makes sense, right? They are\\nonly imposing these things because they care, right? Right?\\nSubmitting to insanity\\nPsychological reframing of the population goes very deep and is\\ndone in many less obvious ways. I hear people say how\\ncontradictory and crazy ‘Covid’ rules are and how they are ever\\nchanging. This is explained away by dismissing those involved as\\nidiots. It is a big mistake. The Cult is delighted if its cold calculation\\nis perceived as incompetence and idiocy when it is anything but. Oh,\\nyes, there are idiots within the system – lots of them – but they are\\nadministering the Cult agenda, mostly unknowingly. They are not\\ndeciding and dictating it. The bulwark against tyranny is self- respect, always has been, always will be. It is self-respect that has\\nbroken every tyranny in history. By its very nature self-respect will\\nnot bow to oppression and its perpetrators. There is so li\\x00le self-\\nrespect that it’s always the few that overturn dictators. Many may\\neventually follow, but the few with the iron spines (self-respect) kick\\nit oﬀ and generate the momentum. The Cult targets self-respect in\\nthe knowledge that once this has gone only submission remains.\\nCrazy, contradictory, ever-changing ‘Covid’ rules are systematically\\napplied by psychologists to delete self-respect. They want you to see\\nthat the rules make no sense. It is one thing to decide to do\\nsomething when you have made the choice based on evidence and\\nlogic. You still retain your self-respect. It is quite another when you\\ncan see what you are being told to do is insane, ridiculous and\\nmakes no sense, and yet you still do it. Your self-respect is\\nextinguished and this has been happening as ever more obviously\\nstupid and nonsensical things have been demanded and the great\\nmajority have complied even when they can see they are stupid and\\nnonsensical.\\nPeople walk around in face-nappies knowing they are damaging\\ntheir health and make no diﬀerence to a ‘virus’. They do it in fear of\\nnot doing it. I know it’s da\\x00, but I’ll do it anyway. When that\\nhappens something dies inside of you and submissive reframing has\\nbegun. Next there’s a need to hide from yourself that you have\\nconceded your self-respect and you convince yourself that you have\\nnot really submi\\x00ed to fear and intimidation. You begin to believe\\nthat you are complying with craziness because it’s the right thing to\\ndo. When ﬁrst you concede your self-respect of 2+2 = 4 to 2+2 = 5 you\\nknow you are compromising your self-respect. Gradually to avoid\\nfacing that fact you begin to believe that 2+2=5. You have been\\nreframed and I have been watching this process happening in the\\nhuman psyche on an industrial scale. The Cult is working to break\\nyour spirit and one of its major tools in that war is humiliation. I\\nread how former American soldier Bradley Manning (later Chelsea\\nManning a\\x00er a sex-change) was treated a\\x00er being jailed for\\nsupplying WikiLeaks with documents exposing the enormity of government and elite mendacity. Manning was isolated in solitary\\nconﬁnement for eight months, put under 24-hour surveillance,\\nforced to hand over clothing before going to bed, and stand naked\\nfor every roll call. This is systematic humiliation. The introduction of\\nanal swab ‘Covid’ tests in China has been done for the same reason\\nto delete self-respect and induce compliant submission. Anal swabs\\nare mandatory for incoming passengers in parts of China and\\nAmerican diplomats have said they were forced to undergo the\\nindignity which would have been calculated humiliation by the\\nCult-owned Chinese government that has America in its sights.\\nGovernment-people: An abusive relationship\\nSpirit-breaking psychological techniques include giving people hope\\nand apparent respite from tyranny only to take it away again. This\\nhappened in the UK during Christmas, 2020, when the psycho-\\npsychologists and their political lackeys announced an easing of\\nrestrictions over the holiday only to reimpose them almost\\nimmediately on the basis of yet another lie. There is a big\\npsychological diﬀerence between ge\\x00ing used to oppression and\\nbeing given hope of relief only to have that dashed. Psychologists\\nknow this and we have seen the technique used repeatedly. Then\\nthere is traumatising people before you introduce more extreme\\nregulations that require compliance. A perfect case was the\\nannouncement by the dark and sinister Whi\\x00y and Vallance in the\\nUK that ‘new data’ predicted that 4,000 could die every day over the\\nwinter of 2020/2021 if we did not lockdown again. I think they call it\\nlying and a\\x00er traumatising people with that claim out came\\nJackboot Johnson the next day with new curbs on human freedom.\\nPsychologists know that a frightened and traumatised mind\\nbecomes suggestable to submission and behaviour reframing.\\nUnderpinning all this has been to make people fearful and\\nsuspicious of each other and see themselves as a potential danger to\\nothers. In league with deleted self-respect you have the perfect\\npsychological recipe for self-loathing. The relationship between\\nauthority and public is now demonstrably the same as that of subservience to an abusive partner. These are signs of an abusive\\nrelationship explained by psychologist Leslie Becker-Phelps:\\nPsychological and emotional abuse: Undermining a partner’s\\nself-worth with verbal a\\x00acks, name-calling, and beli\\x00ling.\\nHumiliating the partner in public, unjustly accusing them of having\\nan aﬀair, or interrogating them about their every behavior. Keeping\\npartner confused or oﬀ balance by saying they were just kidding or\\nblaming the partner for ‘making’ them act this way … Feigning in\\npublic that they care while turning against them in private. This\\nleads to victims frequently feeling confused, incompetent, unworthy,\\nhopeless, and chronically self-doubting. [Apply these techniques to\\nhow governments have treated the population since New Year, 2020,\\nand the parallels are obvious.]\\nPhysical abuse: The abuser might physically harm their partner in\\na range of ways, such as grabbing, hi\\x00ing, punching, or shoving\\nthem. They might throw objects at them or harm them with a\\nweapon. [Observe the physical harm imposed by masks, lockdown,\\nand so on.]\\nThreats and intimidation: One way abusers keep their partners in\\nline is by instilling fear. They might be verbally threatening, or give\\nthreatening looks or gestures. Abusers o\\x00en make it known that\\nthey are tracking their partner’s every move. They might destroy\\ntheir partner’s possessions, threaten to harm them, or threaten to\\nharm their family members. Not surprisingly, victims of this abuse\\no\\x00en feel anxiety, fear, and panic. [No words necessary.]\\nIsolation: Abusers o\\x00en limit their partner’s activities, forbidding\\nthem to talk or interact with friends or family. They might limit\\naccess to a car or even turn oﬀ their phone. All of this might be done\\nby physically holding them against their will, but is o\\x00en\\naccomplished through psychological abuse and intimidation. The\\nmore isolated a person feels, the fewer resources they have to help\\ngain perspective on their situation and to escape from it. [No words\\nnecessary.] Economic abuse: Abusers o\\x00en make their partners beholden to\\nthem for money by controlling access to funds of any kind. They\\nmight prevent their partner from ge\\x00ing a job or withhold access to\\nmoney they earn from a job. This creates ﬁnancial dependency that\\nmakes leaving the relationship very diﬃcult. [See destruction of\\nlivelihoods and the proposed meagre ‘guaranteed income’ so long as\\nyou do whatever you are told.]\\nUsing children: An abuser might disparage their partner’s\\nparenting skills, tell their children lies about their partner, threaten\\nto take custody of their children, or threaten to harm their children.\\nThese tactics instil fear and o\\x00en elicit compliance. [See reframed\\nsocial service maﬁa and how children are being mercilessly abused\\nby the state over ‘Covid’ while their parents look on too frightened\\nto do anything.]\\nA further recurring trait in an abusive relationship is the abused\\nblaming themselves for their abuse and making excuses for the\\nabuser. We have the public blaming each other for lockdown abuse\\nby government and many making excuses for the government while\\na\\x00acking those who challenge the government. How o\\x00en we have\\nheard authorities say that rules are being imposed or reimposed only\\nbecause people have refused to ‘behave’ and follow the rules. We\\ndon’t want to do it – it’s you.\\nRenegade Minds are an antidote to all of these things. They will\\nnever concede their self-respect no ma\\x00er what the circumstances.\\nEven when apparent humiliation is heaped upon them they laugh in\\nits face and reﬂect back the humiliation on the abuser where it\\nbelongs. Renegade Minds will never wear masks they know are only\\nimposed to humiliate, suppress and damage both physically and\\npsychologically. Consequences will take care of themselves and they\\nwill never break their spirit or cause them to concede to tyranny. UK\\nnewspaper columnist Peter Hitchens was one of the few in the\\nmainstream media to speak out against lockdowns and forced\\nvaccinations. He then announced he had taken the jab. He wanted to\\nsee family members abroad and he believed vaccine passports were\\ninevitable even though they had not yet been introduced. Hitchens has a questioning and critical mind, but not a Renegade one. If he\\nhad no amount of pressure would have made him concede. Hitchens\\nexcused his action by saying that the ba\\x00le has been lost. Renegade\\nMinds never accept defeat when freedom is at stake and even if they\\nare the last one standing the self-respect of not submi\\x00ing to tyranny\\nis more important than any outcome or any consequence.\\nThat’s why Renegade Minds are the only minds that ever changed\\nanything worth changing. ‘R\\nCHAPTER EIGHT\\n‘Reframing’ insanity\\nInsanity is relative. It depends on who has who locked in what cage\\nRay Bradbury\\neframing’ a mind means simply to change its perception and\\nbehaviour. This can be done subconsciously to such an extent\\nthat subjects have no idea they have been ‘reframed’ while to any\\nobserver changes in behaviour and a\\x00itudes are obvious.\\nHuman society is being reframed on a ginormous scale since the\\nstart of 2020 and here we have the reason why psychologists rather\\nthan doctors have been calling the shots. Ask most people who have\\nsuccumbed to ‘Covid’ reframing if they have changed and most will\\nsay ‘no’; but they have and fundamentally. The Cult’s long-game has\\nbeen preparing for these times since way back and crucial to that has\\nbeen to prepare both population and oﬃcialdom mentally and\\nemotionally. To use the mind-control parlance they had to reframe\\nthe population with a mentality that would submit to fascism and\\nreframe those in government and law enforcement to impose\\nfascism or at least go along with it. The result has been the fact-\\ndeleted mindlessness of ‘Wokeness’ and oﬃcialdom that has either\\nenthusiastically or unquestioningly imposed global tyranny\\ndemanded by reframed politicians on behalf of psychopathic and\\ndeeply evil cultists. ‘Cognitive reframing’ identiﬁes and challenges\\nthe way someone sees the world in the form of situations,\\nexperiences and emotions and then restructures those perceptions to\\nview the same set of circumstances in a diﬀerent way. This can have beneﬁts if the a\\x00itudes are personally destructive while on the other\\nside it has the potential for individual and collective mind control\\nwhich the subject has no idea has even happened.\\nCognitive therapy was developed in the 1960s by Aaron T. Beck\\nwho was born in Rhode Island in 1921 as the son of Jewish\\nimmigrants from the Ukraine. He became interested in the\\ntechniques as a treatment for depression. Beck’s daughter Judith S.\\nBeck is prominent in the same ﬁeld and they founded the Beck\\nInstitute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Philadelphia in 1994.\\nCognitive reframing, however, began to be used worldwide by those\\nwith a very dark agenda. The Cult reframes politicians to change\\ntheir a\\x00itudes and actions until they are completely at odds with\\nwhat they once appeared to stand for. The same has been happening\\nto government administrators at all levels, law enforcement, military\\nand the human population. Cultists love mind control for two main\\nreasons: It allows them to control what people think, do and say to\\nsecure agenda advancement and, by deﬁnition, it calms their\\nlegendary insecurity and fear of the unexpected. I have studied mind\\ncontrol since the time I travelled America in 1996. I may have been\\ntalking to next to no one in terms of an audience in those years, but\\nmy goodness did I gather a phenomenal amount of information and\\nknowledge about so many things including the techniques of mind\\ncontrol. I have described this in detail in other books going back to\\nThe Biggest Secret in 1998. I met a very large number of people\\nrecovering from MKUltra and its oﬀshoots and successors and I\\nbegan to see how these same techniques were being used on the\\npopulation in general. This was never more obvious than since the\\n‘Covid’ hoax began.\\nReframing the enforcers\\nI have observed over the last two decades and more the very clear\\ntransformation in the dynamic between the police, oﬃcialdom and\\nthe public. I tracked this in the books as the relationship mutated\\nfrom one of serving the public to seeing them as almost the enemy\\nand certainly a lower caste. There has always been a class divide based on income and always been some psychopathic, corrupt, and\\nbig-I-am police oﬃcers. This was diﬀerent. Wholesale change was\\nunfolding in the collective dynamic; it was less about money and far\\nmore about position and perceived power. An us-and-them was\\nemerging. Noses were li\\x00ed skyward by government administration\\nand law enforcement and their a\\x00itude to the public they were\\nsupposed to be serving changed to one of increasing contempt,\\nsuperiority and control. The transformation was so clear and\\nwidespread that it had to be planned. Collective a\\x00itudes and\\ndynamics do not change naturally and organically that quickly on\\nthat scale. I then came across an organisation in Britain called\\nCommon Purpose created in the late 1980s by Julia Middleton who\\nwould work in the oﬃce of Deputy Prime Minister John Presco\\x00\\nduring the long and disastrous premiership of war criminal Tony\\nBlair. When Blair speaks the Cult is speaking and the man should\\nhave been in jail a long time ago. Common Purpose proclaims itself\\nto be one of the biggest ‘leadership development’ organisations in\\nthe world while functioning as a charity with all the ﬁnancial beneﬁts\\nwhich come from that. It hosts ‘leadership development’ courses and\\nprogrammes all over the world and claims to have ‘brought\\ntogether’ what it calls ‘leaders’ from more than 100 countries on six\\ncontinents. The modus operandi of Common Purpose can be\\ncompared with the work of the UK government’s reframing network\\nthat includes the Behavioural Insights Team ‘nudge unit’ and\\n‘Covid’ reframing specialists at SPI-B. WikiLeaks described\\nCommon Purpose long ago as ‘a hidden virus in our government\\nand schools’ which is unknown to the general public: ‘It recruits and\\ntrains “leaders” to be loyal to the directives of Common Purpose and\\nthe EU, instead of to their own departments, which they then\\nundermine or subvert, the NHS [National Health Service] being an\\nexample.’ This is a vital point to understand the ‘Covid’ hoax. The\\nNHS, and its equivalent around the world, has been u\\x00erly reframed\\nin terms of administrators and much of the medical personnel with\\nthe transformation underpinned by recruitment policies. The\\noutcome has been the criminal and psychopathic behaviour of the NHS over ‘Covid’ and we have seen the same in every other major\\ncountry. WikiLeaks said Common Purpose trainees are ‘learning to\\nrule without regard to democracy’ and to usher in a police state\\n(current events explained). Common Purpose operated like a ‘glue’\\nand had members in the NHS, BBC, police, legal profession, church,\\nmany of Britain’s 7,000 quangos, local councils, the Civil Service,\\ngovernment ministries and Parliament, and controlled many RDA’s\\n(Regional Development Agencies). Here we have one answer for\\nhow and why British institutions and their like in other countries\\nhave changed so negatively in relation to the public. This further\\nexplains how and why the beyond-disgraceful reframed BBC has\\nbecome a propaganda arm of ‘Covid’ fascism. They are all part of a\\nnetwork pursuing the same goal.\\nBy 2019 Common Purpose was quoting a ﬁgure of 85,000 ‘leaders’\\nthat had a\\x00ended its programmes. These ‘students’ of all ages are\\nknown as Common Purpose ‘graduates’ and they consist of\\ngovernment, state and local government oﬃcials and administrators,\\npolice chiefs and oﬃcers, and a whole range of others operating\\nwithin the national, local and global establishment. Cressida Dick,\\nCommissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, is the Common\\nPurpose graduate who was the ‘Gold Commander’ that oversaw\\nwhat can only be described as the murder of Brazilian electrician\\nJean Charles de Menezes in 2005. He was held down by\\npsychopathic police and shot seven times in the head by a\\npsychopathic lunatic a\\x00er being mistaken for a terrorist when he\\nwas just a bloke going about his day. Dick authorised oﬃcers to\\npursue and keep surveillance on de Menezes and ordered that he be\\nstopped from entering the underground train system. Police\\npsychopaths took her at her word clearly. She was ‘disciplined’ for\\nthis outrage by being promoted – eventually to the top of the ‘Met’\\npolice where she has been a disaster. Many Chief Constables\\ncontrolling the police in diﬀerent parts of the UK are and have been\\nCommon Purpose graduates. I have heard the ‘graduate’ network\\ndescribed as a sort of Maﬁa or secret society operating within the\\nfabric of government at all levels pursuing a collective policy ingrained at Common Purpose training events. Founder Julia\\nMiddleton herself has said:\\nLocally and internationally, Common Purpose graduates will be ‘lighting small fires’ to create\\nchange in their organisations and communities … The Common Purpose effect is best\\nillustrated by the many stories of small changes brought about by leaders, who themselves\\nhave changed.\\nA Common Purpose mission statement declared:\\nCommon Purpose aims to improve the way society works by expanding the vision, decision-\\nmaking ability and influence of all kinds of leaders. The organisation runs a variety of\\neducational programmes for leaders of all ages, backgrounds and sectors, in order to provide\\nthem with the inspirational, information and opportunities they need to change the world.\\nYes, but into what? Since 2020 the answer has become clear.\\nNLP and the Delphi technique\\nCommon Purpose would seem to be a perfect name or would\\ncommon programming be be\\x00er? One of the foundation methods of\\nreaching ‘consensus’ (group think) is by se\\x00ing the agenda theme\\nand then encouraging, cajoling or pressuring everyone to agree a\\n‘consensus’ in line with the core theme promoted by Common\\nPurpose. The methodology involves the ‘Delphi technique’, or an\\nadaption of it, in which opinions are expressed that are summarised\\nby a ‘facilitator or change agent’ at each stage. Participants are\\n‘encouraged’ to modify their views in the light of what others have\\nsaid. Stage by stage the former individual opinions are merged into\\ngroup consensus which just happens to be what Common Purpose\\nwants them to believe. A key part of this is to marginalise anyone\\nrefusing to concede to group think and turn the group against them\\nto apply pressure to conform. We are seeing this very technique used\\non the general population to make ‘Covid’ group-thinkers hostile to\\nthose who have seen through the bullshit. People can be reframed by\\nusing perception manipulation methods such as Neuro-Linguistic\\nProgramming (NLP) in which you change perception with the use of carefully constructed language. An NLP website described the\\ntechnique this way:\\n… A method of influencing brain behaviour (the ‘neuro’ part of the phrase) through the use of\\nlanguage (the ‘linguistic’ part) and other types of communication to enable a person to\\n‘recode’ the way the brain responds to stimuli (that’s the ‘programming’) and manifest new\\nand better behaviours. Neuro-Linguistic Programming often incorporates hypnosis and self-\\nhypnosis to help achieve the change (or ‘programming’) that is wanted.\\nBritish alternative media operation UKColumn has done very\\ndetailed research into Common Purpose over a long period. I quoted\\nco-founder and former naval oﬃcer Brian Gerrish in my book\\nRemember Who You Are, published in 2011, as saying the following\\nyears before current times:\\nIt is interesting that many of the mothers who have had children taken by the State speak of\\nthe Social Services people being icily cool, emotionless and, as two ladies said in slightly\\ndifferent words, ‘… like little robots’. We know that NLP is cumulative, so people can be\\ngiven small imperceptible doses of NLP in a course here, another in a few months, next year\\netc. In this way, major changes are accrued in their personality, but the day by day change is\\nalmost unnoticeable.\\nIn these and other ways ‘graduates’ have had their perceptions\\nuniformly reframed and they return to their roles in the institutions\\nof government, law enforcement, legal profession, military,\\n‘education’, the UK National Health Service and the whole swathe of\\nthe establishment structure to pursue a common agenda preparing\\nfor the ‘post-industrial’, ‘post-democratic’ society. I say ‘preparing’\\nbut we are now there. ‘Post-industrial’ is code for the Great Reset\\nand ‘post-democratic’ is ‘Covid’ fascism. UKColumn has spoken to\\npartners of those who have a\\x00ended Common Purpose ‘training’.\\nThey have described how personalities and a\\x00itudes of ‘graduates’\\nchanged very noticeably for the worse by the time they had\\ncompleted the course. They had been ‘reframed’ and told they are\\nthe ‘leaders’ – the special ones – who know be\\x00er than the\\npopulation. There has also been the very demonstrable recruitment\\nof psychopaths and narcissists into government administration at all levels and law enforcement. If you want psychopathy hire\\npsychopaths and you get a simple cause and eﬀect. If you want\\nadministrators, police oﬃcers and ‘leaders’ to perceive the public as\\nlesser beings who don’t ma\\x00er then employ narcissists. These\\npersonalities are identiﬁed using ‘psychometrics’ that identiﬁes\\nknowledge, abilities, a\\x00itudes and personality traits, mostly through\\ncarefully-designed questionnaires and tests. As this policy has\\npassed through the decades we have had power-crazy, power-\\ntrippers appointed into law enforcement, security and government\\nadministration in preparation for current times and the dynamic\\nbetween public and law enforcement/oﬃcialdom has been\\ntransformed. UKColumn’s Brian Gerrish said of the narcissistic\\npersonality:\\nTheir love of themselves and power automatically means that they will crush others who get\\nin their way. I received a major piece of the puzzle when a friend pointed out that when they\\nmade public officials re-apply for their own jobs several years ago they were also required to\\ndo psychometric tests. This was undoubtedly the start of the screening process to get ‘their’\\nsort of people in post.\\nHow obvious that has been since 2020 although it was clear what\\nwas happening long before if people paid a\\x00ention to the changing\\npublic-establishment dynamic.\\nChange agents\\nAt the centre of events in ‘Covid’ Britain is the National Health\\nService (NHS) which has behaved disgracefully in slavishly\\nfollowing the Cult agenda. The NHS management structure is awash\\nwith Common Purpose graduates or ‘change agents’ working to a\\ncommon cause. Helen Bevan, a Chief of Service Transformation at\\nthe NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement, co-authored a\\ndocument called ‘Towards a million change agents, a review of the\\nsocial movements literature: implications for large scale change in\\nthe NHS‘. The document compared a project management approach\\nto that of change and social movements where ‘people change themselves and each other – peer to peer’. Two deﬁnitions given for\\na ‘social movement’ were:\\nA group of people who consciously attempt to build a radically new social\\norder; involves people of a broad range of social backgrounds; and deploys\\npolitically confrontational and socially disruptive tactics – Cyrus\\nZirakzadeh 1997\\nCollective challenges, based on common purposes and social solidarities, in\\nsustained interaction with elites, opponents, and authorities – Sidney\\nTarrow 1994\\nHelen Bevan wrote another NHS document in which she deﬁned\\n‘framing’ as ‘the process by which leaders construct, articulate and\\nput across their message in a powerful and compelling way in order\\nto win people to their cause and call them to action’. I think I could\\ncome up with another deﬁnition that would be rather more accurate.\\nThe National Health Service and institutions of Britain and the wider\\nworld have been taken over by reframed ‘change agents’ and that\\nincludes everything from the United Nations to national\\ngovernments, local councils and social services which have been\\nkidnapping children from loving parents on an extraordinary and\\ngathering scale on the road to the end of parenthood altogether.\\nChildren from loving homes are stolen and kidnapped by the state\\nand put into the ‘care’ (inversion) of the local authority through\\ncouncil homes, foster parents and forced adoption. At the same time\\nchildren are allowed to be abused without response while many are\\nunder council ‘care’. UKColumn highlighted the Common Purpose\\nconnection between South Yorkshire Police and Rotherham council\\noﬃcers in the case of the scandal in that area of the sexual\\nexploitation of children to which the authorities turned not one blind\\neye, but both: We were alarmed to discover that the Chief Executive, the Strategic Director of Children and\\nYoung People’s Services, the Manager for the Local Strategic Partnership, the Community\\nCohesion Manager, the Cabinet Member for Cohesion, the Chief Constable and his\\npredecessor had all attended Leadership training courses provided by the pseudo-charity\\nCommon Purpose.\\nOnce ‘change agents’ have secured positions of hire and ﬁre within\\nany organisation things start to move very quickly. Personnel are\\nthen hired and ﬁred on the basis of whether they will work towards\\nthe agenda the change agent represents. If they do they are rapidly\\npromoted even though they may be incompetent. Those more\\nqualiﬁed and skilled who are pre-Common Purpose ‘old school’ see\\ntheir careers stall and even disappear. This has been happening for\\ndecades in every institution of state, police, ‘health’ and social\\nservices and all of them have been transformed as a result in their\\na\\x00itudes to their jobs and the public. Medical professions, including\\nnursing, which were once vocations for the caring now employ\\nmany cold, callous and couldn’t give a shit personality types. The\\nUKColumn investigation concluded:\\nBy blurring the boundaries between people, professions, public and private sectors,\\nresponsibility and accountability, Common Purpose encourages ‘graduates’ to believe that as\\nnew selected leaders, they can work together, outside of the established political and social\\nstructures, to achieve a paradigm shift or CHANGE – so called ‘Leading Beyond Authority’. In\\ndoing so, the allegiance of the individual becomes ‘reframed’ on CP colleagues and their\\nNETWORK.\\nReframing the Face-Nappies\\nNowhere has this process been more obvious than in the police\\nwhere recruitment of psychopaths and development of\\nunquestioning mind-controlled group-thinkers have transformed\\nlaw enforcement into a politically-correct ‘Woke’ joke and a travesty\\nof what should be public service. Today they wear their face-nappies\\nlike good li\\x00le gofers and enforce ‘Covid’ rules which are fascism\\nunder another name. Alongside the speciﬁcally-recruited\\npsychopaths we have so\\x00ware minds incapable of free thought.\\nBrian Gerrish again: An example is the policeman who would not get on a bike for a press photo because he had\\nnot done the cycling proficiency course. Normal people say this is political correctness gone\\nmad. Nothing could be further from the truth. The policeman has been reframed, and in his\\nreality it is perfect common sense not to get on the bike ‘because he hasn’t done the cycling\\ncourse’.\\nAnother example of this is where the police would not rescue a boy from a pond until they\\nhad taken advice from above on the ‘risk assessment’. A normal person would have arrived,\\nperhaps thought of the risk for a moment, and dived in. To the police now ‘reframed’, they\\nfollowed ‘normal’ procedure.\\nThere are shocking cases of reframed ambulance crews doing the\\nsame. Sheer unthinking stupidity of London Face-Nappies headed\\nby Common Purpose graduate Cressida Dick can be seen in their\\nbehaviour at a vigil in March, 2021, for a murdered woman, Sarah\\nEverard. A police oﬃcer had been charged with the crime. Anyone\\nwith a brain would have le\\x00 the vigil alone in the circumstances.\\nInstead they ‘manhandled’ women to stop them breaking ‘Covid\\nrules’ to betray classic reframing. Minds in the thrall of perception\\ncontrol have no capacity for seeing a situation on its merits and\\nacting accordingly. ‘Rules is rules’ is their only mind-set. My father\\nused to say that rules and regulations are for the guidance of the\\nintelligent and the blind obedience of the idiot. Most of the\\nintelligent, decent, coppers have gone leaving only the other kind\\nand a few old school for whom the job must be a daily nightmare.\\nThe combination of psychopaths and rule-book so\\x00ware minds has\\nbeen clearly on public display in the ‘Covid’ era with automaton\\nrobots in uniform imposing fascistic ‘Covid’ regulations on the\\npopulation without any personal initiative or judging situations on\\ntheir merits. There are thousands of examples around the world, but\\nI’ll make my point with the infamous Derbyshire police in the\\nEnglish East Midlands – the ones who think pouring dye into beauty\\nspots and using drones to track people walking in the countryside\\naway from anyone is called ‘policing’. To them there are rules\\ndecreed by the government which they have to enforce and in their\\nbewildered state a group gathering in a closed space and someone\\nwalking alone in the countryside are the same thing. It is beyond\\nidiocy and enters the realm of clinical insanity. Police oﬃcers in Derbyshire said they were ‘horriﬁed’ – horrified –\\nto ﬁnd 15 to 20 ‘irresponsible’ kids playing a football match at a\\nclosed leisure centre ‘in breach of coronavirus restrictions’. When\\nthey saw the police the kids ran away leaving their belongings\\nbehind and the reframed men and women of Derbyshire police were\\nseeking to establish their identities with a view to ﬁning their\\nparents. The most natural thing for youngsters to do – kicking a ball\\nabout – is turned into a criminal activity and enforced by the\\nmoronic so\\x00ware programs of Derbyshire police. You ﬁnd the same\\nmentality in every country. These barely conscious ‘horriﬁed’ oﬃcers\\nsaid they had to take action because ‘we need to ensure these rules\\nare being followed’ and ‘it is of the utmost importance that you\\nensure your children are following the rules and regulations for\\nCovid-19’. Had any of them done ten seconds of research to see if\\nthis parroting of their masters’ script could be supported by any\\nevidence? Nope. Reframed people don’t think – others think for\\nthem and that’s the whole idea of reframing. I have seen police\\noﬃcers one a\\x00er the other repeating without question word for\\nword what oﬃcialdom tells them just as I have seen great swathes of\\nthe public doing the same. Ask either for ‘their’ opinion and out\\nspews what they have been told to think by the oﬃcial narrative.\\nPolice and public may seem to be in diﬀerent groups, but their\\nmentality is the same. Most people do whatever they are told in fear\\nnot doing so or because they believe what oﬃcialdom tells them;\\nalmost the entirety of the police do what they are told for the same\\nreason. Ultimately it’s the tiny inner core of the global Cult that’s\\ntelling both what to do.\\nSo Derbyshire police were ‘horriﬁed’. Oh, really? Why did they\\nthink those kids were playing football? It was to relieve the\\npsychological consequences of lockdown and being denied human\\ncontact with their friends and interaction, touch and discourse vital\\nto human psychological health. Being denied this month a\\x00er month\\nhas dismantled the psyche of many children and young people as\\ndepression and suicide have exploded. Were Derbyshire police\\nhorrified by that? Are you kidding? Reframed people don’t have those mental and emotional processes that can see how the impact on the\\npsychological health of youngsters is far more dangerous than any\\n‘virus’ even if you take the mendacious oﬃcial ﬁgures to be true. The\\nreframed are told (programmed) how to act and so they do. The\\nDerbyshire Chief Constable in the ﬁrst period of lockdown when the\\nblack dye and drones nonsense was going on was Peter Goodman.\\nHe was the man who severed the connection between his force and\\nthe Derbyshire Constabulary Male Voice Choir when he decided that\\nit was not inclusive enough to allow women to join. The fact it was a\\nmale voice choir making a particular sound produced by male voices\\nseemed to elude a guy who terrifyingly ran policing in Derbyshire.\\nHe retired weeks a\\x00er his force was condemned as disgraceful by\\nformer Supreme Court Justice Jonathan Sumption for their\\nbehaviour over extreme lockdown impositions. Goodman was\\nreplaced by his deputy Rachel Swann who was in charge when her\\noﬃcers were ‘horriﬁed’. The police statement over the boys\\ncommi\\x00ing the hanging-oﬀence of playing football included the line\\nabout the youngsters being ‘irresponsible in the times we are all\\nliving through’ missing the point that the real relevance of the ‘times\\nwe are all living through’ is the imposition of fascism enforced by\\npsychopaths and reframed minds of police oﬃcers playing such a\\nvital part in establishing the fascist tyranny that their own children\\nand grandchildren will have to live in their entire lives. As a\\ndeﬁnition of insanity that is hard to beat although it might be run\\nclose by imposing masks on people that can have a serious eﬀect on\\ntheir health while wearing a face nappy all day themselves. Once\\nagain public and police do it for the same reason – the authorities tell\\nthem to and who are they to have the self-respect to say no?\\nWokers in uniform\\nHow reframed do you have to be to arrest a six-year-old and take him\\nto court for picking a flower while waiting for a bus? Brain dead police\\nand oﬃcialdom did just that in North Carolina where criminal\\nproceedings happen regularly for children under nine. A\\x00orney\\nJulie Boyer gave the six-year-old crayons and a colouring book during the ‘ﬂower’ hearing while the ‘adults’ decided his fate.\\nCounty Chief District Court Judge Jay Corpening asked: ‘Should a\\nchild that believes in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the tooth\\nfairy be making life-altering decisions?’ Well, of course not, but\\ncommon sense has no meaning when you have a common purpose\\nand a reframed mind. Treating children in this way, and police\\noperating in American schools, is all part of the psychological\\npreparation for children to accept a police state as normal all their\\nadult lives. The same goes for all the cameras and biometric tracking\\ntechnology in schools. Police training is focused on reframing them\\nas snowﬂake Wokers and this is happening in the military. Pentagon\\ntop brass said that ‘training sessions on extremism’ were needed for\\ntroops who asked why they were so focused on the Capitol Building\\nriot when Black Lives Ma\\x00er riots were ignored. What’s the\\ndiﬀerence between them some apparently and rightly asked.\\nActually, there is a diﬀerence. Five people died in the Capitol riot,\\nonly one through violence, and that was a police oﬃcer shooting an\\nunarmed protestor. BLM riots killed at least 25 people and cost\\nbillions. Asking the question prompted the psychopaths and\\nreframed minds that run the Pentagon to say that more ‘education’\\n(programming) was needed. Troop training is all based on\\npsychological programming to make them fodder for the Cult –\\n‘Military men are just dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in\\nforeign policy’ as Cult-to-his-DNA former Secretary of State Henry\\nKissinger famously said. Governments see the police in similar terms\\nand it’s time for those among them who can see this to defend the\\npeople and stop being enforcers of the Cult agenda upon the people.\\nThe US military, like the country itself, is being targeted for\\ndestruction through a long list of Woke impositions. Cult-owned\\ngaga ‘President’ Biden signed an executive order when he took oﬃce\\nto allow taxpayer money to pay for transgender surgery for active\\nmilitary personnel and veterans. Are you a man soldier? No, I’m a\\nLGBTQIA+ with a hint of Skoliosexual and Spectrasexual. Oh, good\\nman. Bad choice of words you bigot. The Pentagon announced in\\nMarch, 2021, the appointment of the ﬁrst ‘diversity and inclusion oﬃcer’ for US Special Forces. Richard Torres-Estrada arrived with\\nthe publication of a ‘D&I Strategic Plan which will guide the\\nenterprise-wide eﬀort to institutionalize and sustain D&I’. If you\\nthink a Special Forces ‘Strategic Plan’ should have something to do\\nwith defending America you haven’t been paying a\\x00ention.\\nDefending Woke is now the military’s new role. Torres-Estrada has\\nposted images comparing Donald Trump with Adolf Hitler and we\\ncan expect no bias from him as a representative of the supposedly\\nnon-political Pentagon. Cable news host Tucker Carlson said: ‘The\\nPentagon is now the Yale faculty lounge but with cruise missiles.’\\nMeanwhile Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, a board member of\\nweapons-maker Raytheon with stock and compensation interests in\\nOctober, 2020, worth $1.4 million, said he was purging the military\\nof the ‘enemy within’ – anyone who isn’t Woke and supports Donald\\nTrump. Austin refers to his targets as ‘racist extremists’ while in true\\nWoke fashion being himself a racist extremist. Pentagon documents\\npledge to ‘eradicate, eliminate and conquer all forms of racism,\\nsexism and homophobia’. The deﬁnitions of these are decided by\\n‘diversity and inclusion commi\\x00ees’ peopled by those who see\\nracism, sexism and homophobia in every situation and opinion.\\nWoke (the Cult) is dismantling the US military and purging\\ntestosterone as China expands its military and gives its troops\\n‘masculinity training’. How do we think that is going to end when\\nthis is all Cult coordinated? The US military, like the British military,\\nis controlled by Woke and spineless top brass who just go along with\\nit out of personal career interests.\\n‘Woke’ means fast asleep\\nMind control and perception manipulation techniques used on\\nindividuals to create group-think have been unleashed on the global\\npopulation in general. As a result many have no capacity to see the\\nobvious fascist agenda being installed all around them or what\\n‘Covid’ is really all about. Their brains are ﬁrewalled like a computer\\nsystem not to process certain concepts, thoughts and realisations that\\nare bad for the Cult. The young are most targeted as the adults they will be when the whole fascist global state is planned to be fully\\nimplemented. They need to be prepared for total compliance to\\neliminate all pushback from entire generations. The Cult has been\\npouring billions into taking complete control of ‘education’ from\\nschools to universities via its operatives and corporations and not\\nleast Bill Gates as always. The plan has been to transform ‘education’\\ninstitutions into programming centres for the mentality of ‘Woke’.\\nJames McConnell, professor of psychology at the University of\\nMichigan, wrote in Psychology Today in 1970:\\nThe day has come when we can combine sensory deprivation with drugs, hypnosis, and\\nastute manipulation of reward and punishment, to gain almost absolute control over an\\nindividual’s behaviour. It should then be possible to achieve a very rapid and highly effective\\ntype of brainwashing that would allow us to make dramatic changes in a person’s behaviour\\nand personality ...\\n… We should reshape society so that we all would be trained from birth to want to do what\\nsociety wants us to do. We have the techniques to do it... no-one owns his own personality\\nyou acquired, and there’s no reason to believe you should have the right to refuse to acquire a\\nnew personality if your old one is anti-social.\\nThis was the potential for mass brainwashing in 1970 and the\\nmentality there displayed captures the arrogant psychopathy that\\ndrives it forward. I emphasise that not all young people have\\nsuccumbed to Woke programming and those that haven’t are\\nincredibly impressive people given that today’s young are the most\\nperceptually-targeted generations in history with all the technology\\nnow involved. Vast swathes of the young generations, however, have\\nfallen into the spell – and that’s what it is – of Woke. The Woke\\nmentality and perceptual program is founded on inversion and you\\nwill appreciate later why that is so signiﬁcant. Everything with Woke\\nis inverted and the opposite of what it is claimed to be. Woke was a\\nterm used in African-American culture from the 1900s and referred\\nto an awareness of social and racial justice. This is not the meaning\\nof the modern version or ‘New Woke’ as I call it in The Answer. Oh,\\nno, Woke today means something very diﬀerent no ma\\x00er how\\nmuch Wokers may seek to hide that and insist Old Woke and New •\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nWoke are the same. See if you ﬁnd any ‘awareness of social justice’\\nhere in the modern variety:\\nWoke demands ‘inclusivity’ while excluding anyone with a\\ndiﬀerent opinion and calls for mass censorship to silence other\\nviews.\\nWoke claims to stand against oppression when imposing\\noppression is the foundation of all that it does. It is the driver of\\npolitical correctness which is nothing more than a Cult invention\\nto manipulate the population to silence itself.\\nWoke believes itself to be ‘liberal’ while pursuing a global society\\nthat can only be described as fascist (see ‘anti-fascist’ fascist\\nAntifa).\\nWoke calls for ‘social justice’ while spreading injustice wherever it\\ngoes against the common ‘enemy’ which can be easily identiﬁed\\nas a diﬀering view.\\nWoke is supposed to be a metaphor for ‘awake’ when it is solid-\\ngold asleep and deep in a Cult-induced coma that meets the\\ncriteria for ‘oﬀ with the fairies’.\\nI state these points as obvious facts if people only care to look. I\\ndon’t do this with a sense of condemnation. We need to appreciate\\nthat the onslaught of perceptual programming on the young has\\nbeen incessant and merciless. I can understand why so many have\\nbeen reframed, or, given their youth, framed from the start to see the\\nworld as the Cult demands. The Cult has had access to their minds\\nday a\\x00er day in its ‘education’ system for their entire formative\\nyears. Perception is formed from information received and the Cult-\\ncreated system is a life-long download of information delivered to\\nelicit a particular perception, thus behaviour. The more this has\\nexpanded into still new extremes in recent decades and ever-\\nincreasing censorship has deleted other opinions and information\\nwhy wouldn’t that lead to a perceptual reframing on a mass scale? I have described already cradle-to-grave programming and in more\\nrecent times the targeting of young minds from birth to adulthood\\nhas entered the stratosphere. This has taken the form of skewing\\nwhat is ‘taught’ to ﬁt the Cult agenda and the omnipresent\\ntechniques of group-think to isolate non-believers and pressure them\\ninto line. There has always been a tendency to follow the herd, but\\nwe really are in a new world now in relation to that. We have parents\\nwho can see the ‘Covid’ hoax told by their children not to stop them\\nwearing masks at school, being ‘Covid’ tested or having the ‘vaccine’\\nin fear of the peer-pressure consequences of being diﬀerent. What is\\n‘peer-pressure’ if not pressure to conform to group-think? Renegade\\nMinds never group-think and always retain a set of perceptions that\\nare unique to them. Group-think is always underpinned by\\nconsequences for not group-thinking. Abuse now aimed at those\\nrefusing DNA-manipulating ‘Covid vaccines’ are a potent example\\nof this. The biggest pressure to conform comes from the very group\\nwhich is itself being manipulated. ‘I am programmed to be part of a\\nhive mind and so you must be.’\\nWoke control structures in ‘education’ now apply to every\\nmainstream organisation. Those at the top of the ‘education’\\nhierarchy (the Cult) decide the policy. This is imposed on\\ngovernments through the Cult network; governments impose it on\\nschools, colleges and universities; their leadership impose the policy\\non teachers and academics and they impose it on children and\\nstudents. At any level where there is resistance, perhaps from a\\nteacher or university lecturer, they are targeted by the authorities\\nand o\\x00en ﬁred. Students themselves regularly demand the dismissal\\nof academics (increasingly few) at odds with the narrative that the\\nstudents have been programmed to believe in. It is quite a thought\\nthat students who are being targeted by the Cult become so\\nconsumed by programmed group-think that they launch protests\\nand demand the removal of those who are trying to push back\\nagainst those targeting the students. Such is the scale of perceptual\\ninversion. We see this with ‘Covid’ programming as the Cult\\nimposes the rules via psycho-psychologists and governments on shops, transport companies and businesses which impose them on\\ntheir staﬀ who impose them on their customers who pressure\\nPushbackers to conform to the will of the Cult which is in the\\nprocess of destroying them and their families. Scan all aspects of\\nsociety and you will see the same sequence every time.\\nFact free Woke and hijacking the ‘left’\\nThere is no more potent example of this than ‘Woke’, a mentality\\nonly made possible by the deletion of factual evidence by an\\n‘education’ system seeking to produce an ever more uniform society.\\nWhy would you bother with facts when you don’t know any?\\nDeletion of credible history both in volume and type is highly\\nrelevant. Orwell said: ‘Who controls the past controls the future:\\nwho controls the present controls the past.’ They who control the\\nperception of the past control the perception of the future and they\\nwho control the present control the perception of the past through\\nthe writing and deleting of history. Why would you oppose the\\nimposition of Marxism in the name of Wokeism when you don’t\\nknow that Marxism cost at least 100 million lives in the 20th century\\nalone? Watch videos and read reports in which Woker generations\\nare asked basic historical questions – it’s mind-blowing. A survey of\\n2,000 people found that six percent of millennials (born\\napproximately early1980s to early 2000s) believed the Second World\\nWar (1939-1945) broke out with the assassination of President\\nKennedy (in 1963) and one in ten thought Margaret Thatcher was\\nBritish Prime Minister at the time. She was in oﬃce between 1979\\nand 1990. We are in a post-fact society. Provable facts are no defence\\nagainst the fascism of political correctness or Silicon Valley\\ncensorship. Facts don’t ma\\x00er anymore as we have witnessed with\\nthe ‘Covid’ hoax. Sacriﬁcing uniqueness to the Woke group-think\\nreligion is all you are required to do and that means thinking for\\nyourself is the biggest Woke no, no. All religions are an expression of\\ngroup-think and censorship and Woke is just another religion with\\nan orthodoxy defended by group-think and censorship. Burned at the stake becomes burned on Twi\\x00er which leads back eventually to\\nburned at the stake as Woke humanity regresses to ages past.\\nThe biggest Woke inversion of all is its creators and funders. I\\ngrew up in a traditional le\\x00 of centre political household on a\\ncouncil estate in Leicester in the 1950s and 60s – you know, the le\\x00\\nthat challenged the power of wealth-hoarding elites and threats to\\nfreedom of speech and opinion. In those days students went on\\nmarches defending freedom of speech while today’s Wokers march\\nfor its deletion. What on earth could have happened? Those very\\nelites (collectively the Cult) that we opposed in my youth and early\\nlife have funded into existence the antithesis of that former le\\x00 and\\nhĳacked the ‘brand’ while inverting everything it ever stood for. We\\nhave a mentality that calls itself ‘liberal’ and ‘progressive’ while\\nacting like fascists. Cult billionaires and their corporations have\\nfunded themselves into control of ‘education’ to ensure that Woke\\nprogramming is unceasing throughout the formative years of\\nchildren and young people and that non-Wokers are isolated (that\\nword again) whether they be students, teachers or college professors.\\nThe Cult has funded into existence the now colossal global network\\nof Woke organisations that have spawned and promoted all the\\n‘causes’ on the Cult wish-list for global transformation and turned\\nWokers into demanders of them. Does anyone really think it’s a\\ncoincidence that the Cult agenda for humanity is a carbon (sorry)\\ncopy of the societal transformations desired by Woke?? These are\\nonly some of them:\\nPolitical correctness: The means by which the Cult deletes all public\\ndebates that it knows it cannot win if we had the free-ﬂow of\\ninformation and evidence.\\nHuman-caused ‘climate change’: The means by which the Cult\\nseeks to transform society into a globally-controlled dictatorship\\nimposing its will over the ﬁne detail of everyone’s lives ‘to save the\\nplanet’ which doesn’t actually need saving. Transgender obsession: Preparing collective perception to accept the\\n‘new human’ which would not have genders because it would be\\ncreated technologically and not through procreation. I’ll have much\\nmore on this in Human 2.0.\\nRace obsession: The means by which the Cult seeks to divide and\\nrule the population by triggering racial division through the\\nperception that society is more racist than ever when the opposite is\\nthe case. Is it perfect in that regard? No. But to compare today with\\nthe racism of apartheid and segregation brought to an end by the\\ncivil rights movement in the 1960s is to insult the memory of that\\nmovement and inspirations like Martin Luther King. Why is the\\n‘anti-racism’ industry (which it is) so dominated by privileged white\\npeople?\\nWhite supremacy: This is a label used by privileged white people to\\ndemonise poor and deprived white people pushing back on tyranny\\nto marginalise and destroy them. White people are being especially\\ntargeted as the dominant race by number within Western society\\nwhich the Cult seeks to transform in its image. If you want to change\\na society you must weaken and undermine its biggest group and\\nonce you have done that by using the other groups you next turn on\\nthem to do the same … ‘Then they came for the Jews and I was not a\\nJew so I did nothing.’\\nMass migration: The mass movement of people from the Middle\\nEast, Africa and Asia into Europe, from the south into the United\\nStates and from Asia into Australia are another way the Cult seeks to\\ndilute the racial, cultural and political inﬂuence of white people on\\nWestern society. White people ask why their governments appear to\\nbe working against them while being politically and culturally\\nbiased towards incoming cultures. Well, here’s your answer. In the\\nsame way sexually ‘straight’ people, men and women, ask why the authorities are biased against them in favour of other sexualities. The\\nanswer is the same – that’s the way the Cult wants it to be for very\\nsinister motives.\\nThese are all central parts of the Cult agenda and central parts of the\\nWoke agenda and Woke was created and continues to be funded to\\nan immense degree by Cult billionaires and corporations. If anyone\\nbegins to say ‘coincidence’ the syllables should stick in their throat.\\nBillionaire ‘social justice warriors’\\nJoe Biden is a 100 percent-owned asset of the Cult and the Wokers’\\nman in the White House whenever he can remember his name and\\nfor however long he lasts with his rapidly diminishing cognitive\\nfunction. Even walking up the steps of an aircra\\x00 without falling on\\nhis arse would appear to be a challenge. He’s not an empty-shell\\npuppet or anything. From the minute Biden took oﬃce (or the Cult\\ndid) he began his executive orders promoting the Woke wish-list.\\nYou will see the Woke agenda imposed ever more severely because\\nit’s really the Cult agenda. Woke organisations and activist networks\\nspawned by the Cult are funded to the extreme so long as they\\npromote what the Cult wants to happen. Woke is funded to promote\\n‘social justice’ by billionaires who become billionaires by destroying\\nsocial justice. The social justice mantra is only a cover for\\ndismantling social justice and funded by billionaires that couldn’t\\ngive a damn about social justice. Everything makes sense when you\\nsee that. One of Woke’s premier funders is Cult billionaire ﬁnancier\\nGeorge Soros who said: ‘I am basically there to make money, I\\ncannot and do not look at the social consequences of what I do.’ This\\nis the same Soros who has given more than $32 billion to his Open\\nSociety Foundations global Woke network and funded Black Lives\\nMa\\x00er, mass immigration into Europe and the United States,\\ntransgender activism, climate change activism, political correctness\\nand groups targeting ‘white supremacy’ in the form of privileged\\nwhite thugs that dominate Antifa. What a scam it all is and when you are dealing with the unquestioning fact-free zone of Woke\\nscamming them is child’s play. All you need to pull it oﬀ in all these\\norganisations are a few in-the-know agents of the Cult and an army\\nof naïve, reframed, uninformed, narcissistic, know-nothings\\nconvinced of their own self-righteousness, self-purity and virtue.\\nSoros and fellow billionaires and billionaire corporations have\\npoured hundreds of millions into Black Lives Ma\\x00er and connected\\ngroups and promoted them to a global audience. None of this is\\nmotivated by caring about black people. These are the billionaires\\nthat have controlled and exploited a system that leaves millions of\\nblack people in abject poverty and deprivation which they do\\nabsolutely nothing to address. The same Cult networks funding\\nBLM were behind the slave trade! Black Lives Ma\\x00er hĳacked a\\nphrase that few would challenge and they have turned this laudable\\nconcept into a political weapon to divide society. You know that\\nBLM is a fraud when it claims that All Lives Ma\\x00er, the most\\ninclusive statement of all, is ‘racist’. BLM and its Cult masters don’t\\nwant to end racism. To them it’s a means to an end to control all of\\nhumanity never mind the colour, creed, culture or background.\\nWhat has destroying the nuclear family got to do with ending\\nracism? Nothing – but that is one of the goals of BLM and also\\nhappens to be a goal of the Cult as I have been exposing in my books\\nfor decades. Stealing children from loving parents and giving\\nschools ever more power to override parents is part of that same\\nagenda. BLM is a Marxist organisation and why would that not be\\nthe case when the Cult created Marxism and BLM? Patrisse Cullors, a\\nBLM co-founder, said in a 2015 video that she and her fellow\\norganisers, including co-founder Alicia Garza, are ‘trained Marxists’.\\nThe lady known a\\x00er marriage as Patrisse Khan-Cullors bought a\\n$1.4 million home in 2021 in one of the whitest areas of California\\nwith a black population of just 1.6 per cent and has so far bought four\\nhigh-end homes for a total of $3.2 million. How very Marxist. There\\nmust be a bit of spare in the BLM coﬀers, however, when Cult\\ncorporations and billionaires have handed over the best part of $100\\nmillion. Many black people can see that Black Lives Ma\\x00er is not working for them, but against them, and this is still more\\nconﬁrmation. Black journalist Jason Whitlock, who had his account\\nsuspended by Twi\\x00er for simply linking to the story about the\\n‘Marxist’s’ home buying spree, said that BLM leaders are ‘making\\nmillions of dollars oﬀ the backs of these dead black men who they\\nwouldn’t spit on if they were on ﬁre and alive’.\\nBlack Lies Matter\\nCult assets and agencies came together to promote BLM in the wake\\nof the death of career criminal George Floyd who had been jailed a\\nnumber of times including for forcing his way into the home of a\\nblack woman with others in a raid in which a gun was pointed at her\\nstomach. Floyd was ﬁlmed being held in a Minneapolis street in 2020\\nwith the knee of a police oﬃcer on his neck and he subsequently\\ndied. It was an appalling thing for the oﬃcer to do, but the same\\ntechnique has been used by police on peaceful protestors of\\nlockdown without any outcry from the Woke brigade. As\\nunquestioning supporters of the Cult agenda Wokers have\\nsupported lockdown and all the ‘Covid’ claptrap while a\\x00acking\\nanyone standing up to the tyranny imposed in its name. Court\\ndocuments would later include details of an autopsy on Floyd by\\nCounty Medical Examiner Dr Andrew Baker who concluded that\\nFloyd had taken a fatal level of the drug fentanyl. None of this\\nma\\x00ered to fact-free, question-free, Woke. Floyd’s death was\\nfollowed by worldwide protests against police brutality amid calls to\\ndefund the police. Throwing babies out with the bathwater is a\\nWoke speciality. In the wake of the murder of British woman Sarah\\nEverard a Green Party member of the House of Lords, Baroness\\nJones of Moulescoomb (Nincompoopia would have been be\\x00er),\\ncalled for a 6pm curfew for all men. This would be in breach of the\\nGeneva Conventions on war crimes which ban collective\\npunishment, but that would never have crossed the black and white\\nWoke mind of Baroness Nincompoopia who would have been far\\ntoo convinced of her own self-righteousness to compute such details.\\nMany American cities did defund the police in the face of Floyd riots and a\\x00er $15 million was deleted from the police budget in\\nWashington DC under useless Woke mayor Muriel Bowser car-\\njacking alone rose by 300 percent and within six months the US\\ncapital recorded its highest murder rate in 15 years. The same\\nhappened in Chicago and other cities in line with the Cult/Soros\\nplan to bring fear to streets and neighbourhoods by reducing the\\npolice, releasing violent criminals and not prosecuting crime. This is\\nthe mob-rule agenda that I have warned in the books was coming for\\nso long. Shootings in the area of Minneapolis where Floyd was\\narrested increased by 2,500 percent compared with the year before.\\nDefunding the police over George Floyd has led to a big increase in\\ndead people with many of them black. Police protection for\\npoliticians making these decisions stayed the same or increased as\\nyou would expect from professional hypocrites. The Cult doesn’t\\nactually want to abolish the police. It wants to abolish local control\\nover the police and hand it to federal government as the\\npsychopaths advance the Hunger Games Society. Many George\\nFloyd protests turned into violent riots with black stores and\\nbusinesses destroyed by ﬁre and looting across America fuelled by\\nBlack Lives Ma\\x00er. Woke doesn’t do irony. If you want civil rights\\nyou must loot the liquor store and the supermarket and make oﬀ\\nwith a smart TV. It’s the only way.\\nIt’s not a race war – it’s a class war\\nBlack people are patronised by privileged blacks and whites alike\\nand told they are victims of white supremacy. I ﬁnd it extraordinary\\nto watch privileged blacks supporting the very system and bloodline\\nnetworks behind the slave trade and parroting the same Cult-serving\\nmanipulative crap of their privileged white, o\\x00en billionaire,\\nassociates. It is indeed not a race war but a class war and colour is\\njust a diversion. Black Senator Cory Booker and black\\nCongresswoman Maxine Waters, more residents of Nincompoopia,\\npersonify this. Once you tell people they are victims of someone else\\nyou devalue both their own responsibility for their plight and the\\npower they have to impact on their reality and experience. Instead we have: ‘You are only in your situation because of whitey – turn on\\nthem and everything will change.’ It won’t change. Nothing changes\\nin our lives unless we change it. Crucial to that is never seeing\\nyourself as a victim and always as the creator of your reality. Life is a\\nsimple sequence of choice and consequence. Make diﬀerent choices\\nand you create diﬀerent consequences. You have to make those\\nchoices – not Black Lives Ma\\x00er, the Woke Maﬁa and anyone else\\nthat seeks to dictate your life. Who are they these Wokers, an\\nemotional and psychological road traﬃc accident, to tell you what to\\ndo? Personal empowerment is the last thing the Cult and its Black\\nLives Ma\\x00er want black people or anyone else to have. They claim to\\nbe defending the underdog while creating and perpetuating the\\nunderdog. The Cult’s worst nightmare is human unity and if they\\nare going to keep blacks, whites and every other race under\\neconomic servitude and control then the focus must be diverted\\nfrom what they have in common to what they can be manipulated to\\nbelieve divides them. Blacks have to be told that their poverty and\\nplight is the fault of the white bloke living on the street in the same\\npoverty and with the same plight they are experiencing. The\\ndiﬀerence is that your plight black people is due to him, a white\\nsupremacist with ‘white privilege’ living on the street. Don’t unite as\\none human family against your mutual oppressors and suppressors\\n– ﬁght the oppressor with the white face who is as ﬁnancially\\ndeprived as you are. The Cult knows that as its ‘Covid’ agenda\\nmoves into still new levels of extremism people are going to respond\\nand it has been spreading the seeds of disunity everywhere to stop a\\nunited response to the evil that targets all of us.\\nRacist a\\x00acks on ‘whiteness’ are ge\\x00ing ever more outrageous and\\nespecially through the American Democratic Party which has an\\nappalling history for anti-black racism. Barack Obama, Joe Biden,\\nHillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi all eulogised about Senator Robert\\nByrd at his funeral in 2010 a\\x00er a nearly 60-year career in Congress.\\nByrd was a brutal Ku Klux Klan racist and a violent abuser of Cathy\\nO’Brien in MKUltra. He said he would never ﬁght in the military\\n‘with a negro by my side’ and ‘rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to\\nsee this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a\\nthrowback to the blackest specimen from the wilds’. Biden called\\nByrd a ‘very close friend and mentor’. These ‘Woke’ hypocrites are\\nnot anti-racist they are anti-poor and anti-people not of their\\nperceived class. Here is an illustration of the scale of anti-white\\nracism to which we have now descended. Seriously Woke and\\nmoronic New York Times contributor Damon Young described\\nwhiteness as a ‘virus’ that ‘like other viruses will not die until there\\nare no bodies le\\x00 for it to infect’. He went on: ‘… the only way to\\nstop it is to locate it, isolate it, extract it, and kill it.’ Young can say\\nthat as a black man with no consequences when a white man saying\\nthe same in reverse would be facing a jail sentence. That’s racism. We\\nhad super-Woke numbskull senators Tammy Duckworth and Mazie\\nHirono saying they would object to future Biden Cabinet\\nappointments if he did not nominate more Asian Americans and\\nPaciﬁc Islanders. Never mind the ability of the candidate what do\\nthey look like? Duckworth said: ‘I will vote for racial minorities and I\\nwill vote for LGBTQ, but anyone else I’m not voting for.’ Appointing\\npeople on the grounds of race is illegal, but that was not a problem\\nfor this ludicrous pair. They were on-message and that’s a free pass\\nin any situation.\\nCritical race racism\\nWhite children are told at school they are intrinsically racist as they\\nare taught the divisive ‘critical race theory’. This claims that the law\\nand legal institutions are inherently racist and that race is a socially\\nconstructed concept used by white people to further their economic\\nand political interests at the expense of people of colour. White is a\\n‘virus’ as we’ve seen. Racial inequality results from ‘social,\\neconomic, and legal diﬀerences that white people create between\\nraces to maintain white interests which leads to poverty and\\ncriminality in minority communities‘. I must tell that to the white\\nguy sleeping on the street. The principal of East Side Community\\nSchool in New York sent white parents a manifesto that called on them to become ‘white traitors’ and advocate for full ‘white\\nabolition’. These people are teaching your kids when they urgently\\nneed a psychiatrist. The ‘school’ included a chart with ‘eight white\\nidentities’ that ranged from ‘white supremacist’ to ‘white abolition’\\nand deﬁned the behaviour white people must follow to end ‘the\\nregime of whiteness’. Woke blacks and their privileged white\\nassociates are acting exactly like the slave owners of old and Ku Klux\\nKlan racists like Robert Byrd. They are too full of their own self-\\npurity to see that, but it’s true. Racism is not a body type; it’s a state\\nof mind that can manifest through any colour, creed or culture.\\nAnother racial fraud is ‘equity’. Not equality of treatment and\\nopportunity – equity. It’s a term spun as equality when it means\\nsomething very diﬀerent. Equality in its true sense is a raising up\\nwhile ‘equity’ is a race to the bo\\x00om. Everyone in the same level of\\npoverty is ‘equity’. Keep everyone down – that’s equity. The Cult\\ndoesn’t want anyone in the human family to be empowered and\\nBLM leaders, like all these ‘anti-racist’ organisations, continue their\\nprivileged, pampered existence by perpetuating the perception of\\ngathering racism. When is the last time you heard an ‘anti-racist’ or\\n‘anti-Semitism’ organisation say that acts of racism and\\ndiscrimination have fallen? It’s not in the interests of their fund-\\nraising and power to inﬂuence and the same goes for the\\nprofessional soccer anti-racism operation, Kick It Out. Two things\\nconﬁrmed that the Black Lives Ma\\x00er riots in the summer of 2020\\nwere Cult creations. One was that while anti-lockdown protests were\\ncondemned in this same period for ‘transmi\\x00ing ‘Covid’ the\\nauthorities supported mass gatherings of Black Lives Ma\\x00er\\nsupporters. I even saw self-deluding people claiming to be doctors\\nsay the two types of protest were not the same. No – the non-existent\\n‘Covid’ was in favour of lockdowns and a\\x00acked those that\\nprotested against them while ‘Covid’ supported Black Lives Ma\\x00er\\nand kept well away from its protests. The whole thing was a joke\\nand as lockdown protestors were arrested, o\\x00en brutally, by\\nreframed Face-Nappies we had the grotesque sight of police oﬃcers\\ntaking the knee to Black Lives Ma\\x00er, a Cult-funded Marxist organisation that supports violent riots and wants to destroy the\\nnuclear family and white people.\\nHe’s not white? Shucks!\\nWoke obsession with race was on display again when ten people\\nwere shot dead in Boulder, Colorado, in March, 2021. Cult-owned\\nWoke TV channels like CNN said the shooter appeared to be a white\\nman and Wokers were on Twi\\x00er condemning ‘violent white men’\\nwith the usual mantras. Then the shooter’s name was released as\\nAhmad Al Aliwi Alissa, an anti-Trump Arab-American, and the sigh\\nof disappointment could be heard ﬁve miles away. Never mind that\\nten people were dead and what that meant for their families. Race\\nbaiting was all that ma\\x00ered to these sick Cult-serving people like\\nBarack Obama who exploited the deaths to further divide America\\non racial grounds which is his job for the Cult. This is the man that\\n‘racist’ white Americans made the ﬁrst black president of the United\\nStates and then gave him a second term. Not-very-bright Obama has\\nbecome ﬁlthy rich on the back of that and today appears to have a\\nbig inﬂuence on the Biden administration. Even so he’s still a\\ndowntrodden black man and a victim of white supremacy. This\\ndisingenuous fraud reveals the contempt he has for black people\\nwhen he puts on a Deep South Alabama accent whenever he talks to\\nthem, no, at them.\\nAnother BLM red ﬂag was how the now fully-Woke (fully-Cult)\\nand fully-virtue-signalled professional soccer authorities had their\\nteams taking the knee before every match in support of Marxist\\nBlack Lives Ma\\x00er. Soccer authorities and clubs displayed ‘Black\\nLives Ma\\x00er’ on the players’ shirts and ﬂashed the name on\\nelectronic billboards around the pitch. Any fans that condemned\\nwhat is a Freemasonic taking-the-knee ritual were widely\\ncondemned as you would expect from the Woke virtue-signallers of\\nprofessional sport and the now fully-Woke media. We have reverse\\nracism in which you are banned from criticising any race or culture\\nexcept for white people for whom anything goes – say what you like,\\nno problem. What has this got to do with racial harmony and equality? We’ve had black supremacists from Black Lives Ma\\x00er\\ntelling white people to fall to their knees in the street and apologise\\nfor their white supremacy. Black supremacists acting like white\\nsupremacist slave owners of the past couldn’t breach their self-\\nobsessed, race-obsessed sense of self-purity. Joe Biden appointed a\\nrace-obsessed black supremacist Kristen Clarke to head the Justice\\nDepartment Civil Rights Division. Clarke claimed that blacks are\\nendowed with ‘greater mental, physical and spiritual abilities’ than\\nwhites. If anyone reversed that statement they would be viliﬁed.\\nClarke is on-message so no problem. She’s never seen a black-white\\nsituation in which the black ﬁgure is anything but a virtuous victim\\nand she heads the Civil Rights Division which should treat everyone\\nthe same or it isn’t civil rights. Another perception of the Renegade\\nMind: If something or someone is part of the Cult agenda they will\\nbe supported by Woke governments and media no ma\\x00er what. If\\nthey’re not, they will be condemned and censored. It really is that\\nsimple and so racist Clarke prospers despite (make that because of)\\nher racism.\\nThe end of culture\\nBiden’s administration is full of such racial, cultural and economic\\nbias as the Cult requires the human family to be divided into\\nwarring factions. We are now seeing racially-segregated graduations\\nand everything, but everything, is deﬁned through the lens of\\nperceived ‘racism. We have ‘racist’ mathematics, ‘racist’ food and\\neven ‘racist’ plants. World famous Kew Gardens in London said it\\nwas changing labels on plants and ﬂowers to tell its pre-‘Covid’\\nmore than two million visitors a year how racist they are. Kew\\ndirector Richard Deverell said this was part of an eﬀort to ‘move\\nquickly to decolonise collections’ a\\x00er they were approached by one\\nAjay Chhabra ‘an actor with an insight into how sugar cane was\\nlinked to slavery’. They are plants you idiots. ‘Decolonisation’ in the\\nWoke manual really means colonisation of society with its mentality\\nand by extension colonisation by the Cult. We are witnessing a new\\nChinese-style ‘Cultural Revolution’ so essential to the success of all Marxist takeovers. Our cultural past and traditions have to be swept\\naway to allow a new culture to be built-back-be\\x00er. Woke targeting\\nof long-standing Western cultural pillars including historical\\nmonuments and cancelling of historical ﬁgures is what happened in\\nthe Mao revolution in China which ‘purged remnants of capitalist\\nand traditional elements from Chinese society‘ and installed Maoism\\nas the dominant ideology‘. For China see the Western world today\\nand for ‘dominant ideology’ see Woke. Be\\x00er still see Marxism or\\nMaoism. The ‘Covid’ hoax has speciﬁcally sought to destroy the arts\\nand all elements of Western culture from people meeting in a pub or\\nrestaurant to closing theatres, music venues, sports stadiums, places\\nof worship and even banning singing. Destruction of Western society\\nis also why criticism of any religion is banned except for Christianity\\nwhich again is the dominant religion as white is the numerically-\\ndominant race. Christianity may be fading rapidly, but its history\\nand traditions are weaved through the fabric of Western society.\\nDelete the pillars and other structures will follow until the whole\\nthing collapses. I am not a Christian defending that religion when I\\nsay that. I have no religion. It’s just a fact. To this end Christianity\\nhas itself been turned Woke to usher its own downfall and its ranks\\nare awash with ‘change agents’ – knowing and unknowing – at\\nevery level including Pope Francis (definitely knowing) and the\\nclueless Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (possibly not, but\\nwho can be sure?). Woke seeks to coordinate a\\x00acks on Western\\nculture, traditions, and ways of life through ‘intersectionality’\\ndeﬁned as ‘the complex, cumulative way in which the eﬀects of\\nmultiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and\\nclassism) combine, overlap, or intersect especially in the experiences\\nof marginalised individuals or groups’. Wade through the Orwellian\\nWoke-speak and this means coordinating disparate groups in a\\ncommon cause to overthrow freedom and liberal values.\\nThe entire structure of public institutions has been infested with\\nWoke – government at all levels, political parties, police, military,\\nschools, universities, advertising, media and trade unions. This\\nabomination has been achieved through the Cult web by appointing Wokers to positions of power and ba\\x00ering non-Wokers into line\\nthrough intimidation, isolation and threats to their job. Many have\\nbeen ﬁred in the wake of the empathy-deleted, vicious hostility of\\n‘social justice’ Wokers and the desire of gutless, spineless employers\\nto virtue-signal their Wokeness. Corporations are ﬁlled with Wokers\\ntoday, most notably those in Silicon Valley. Ironically at the top they\\nare not Woke at all. They are only exploiting the mentality their Cult\\nmasters have created and funded to censor and enslave while the\\nWokers cheer them on until it’s their turn. Thus the Woke ‘liberal\\nle\\x00’ is an inversion of the traditional liberal le\\x00. Campaigning for\\njustice on the grounds of power and wealth distribution has been\\nreplaced by campaigning for identity politics. The genuine\\ntraditional le\\x00 would never have taken money from today’s\\nbillionaire abusers of fairness and justice and nor would the\\nbillionaires have wanted to fund that genuine le\\x00. It would not have\\nbeen in their interests to do so. The division of opinion in those days\\nwas between the haves and have nots. This all changed with Cult\\nmanipulated and funded identity politics. The division of opinion\\ntoday is between Wokers and non-Wokers and not income brackets.\\nCult corporations and their billionaires may have taken wealth\\ndisparity to cataclysmic levels of injustice, but as long as they speak\\nthe language of Woke, hand out the dosh to the Woke network and\\ncensor the enemy they are ‘one of us’. Billionaires who don’t give a\\ndamn about injustice are laughing at them till their bellies hurt.\\nWokers are not even close to self-aware enough to see that. The\\ntransformed ‘le\\x00’ dynamic means that Wokers who drone on about\\n‘social justice’ are funded by billionaires that have destroyed social\\njustice the world over. It’s why they are billionaires.\\nThe climate con\\nNothing encapsulates what I have said more comprehensively than\\nthe hoax of human-caused global warming. I have detailed in my\\nbooks over the years how Cult operatives and organisations were the\\npump-primers from the start of the climate con. A purpose-built\\nvehicle for this is the Club of Rome established by the Cult in 1968 •\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nwith the Rockefellers and Rothschilds centrally involved all along.\\nTheir gofer frontman Maurice Strong, a Canadian oil millionaire,\\nhosted the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 where the\\nglobal ‘green movement’ really expanded in earnest under the\\nguiding hand of the Cult. The Earth Summit established Agenda 21\\nthrough the Cult-created-and-owned United Nations to use the\\nillusion of human-caused climate change to justify the\\ntransformation of global society to save the world from climate\\ndisaster. It is a No-Problem-Reaction-Solution sold through\\ngovernments, media, schools and universities as whole generations\\nhave been terriﬁed into believing that the world was going to end in\\ntheir lifetimes unless what old people had inﬂicted upon them was\\nstopped by a complete restructuring of how everything is done.\\nChill, kids, it’s all a hoax. Such restructuring is precisely what the\\nCult agenda demands (purely by coincidence of course). Today this\\nhas been given the codename of the Great Reset which is only an\\nupdated term for Agenda 21 and its associated Agenda 2030. The\\nla\\x00er, too, is administered through the UN and was voted into being\\nby the General Assembly in 2015. Both 21 and 2030 seek centralised\\ncontrol of all resources and food right down to the raindrops falling\\non your own land. These are some of the demands of Agenda 21\\nestablished in 1992. See if you recognise this society emerging today:\\n \\nEnd national sovereignty\\nState planning and management of all land resources, ecosystems,\\ndeserts, forests, mountains, oceans and fresh water; agriculture;\\nrural development; biotechnology; and ensuring ‘equity’\\nThe state to ‘deﬁne the role’ of business and ﬁnancial resources\\nAbolition of private property\\n‘Restructuring’ the family unit (see BLM)\\nChildren raised by the state\\nPeople told what their job will be\\nMajor restrictions on movement\\nCreation of ‘human se\\x00lement zones’ •\\n•\\n•\\nMass rese\\x00lement as people are forced to vacate land where they\\nlive\\nDumbing down education\\nMass global depopulation in pursuit of all the above\\n \\nThe United Nations was created as a Trojan horse for world\\ngovernment. With the climate con of critical importance to\\npromoting that outcome you would expect the UN to be involved.\\nOh, it’s involved all right. The UN is promoting Agenda 21 and\\nAgenda 2030 justiﬁed by ‘climate change’ while also driving the\\nclimate hoax through its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\\nChange (IPCC), one of the world’s most corrupt organisations. The\\nIPCC has been lying ferociously and constantly since the day it\\nopened its doors with the global media hanging unquestioningly on\\nits every mendacious word. The Green movement is entirely Woke\\nand has long lost its original environmental focus since it was co-\\nopted by the Cult. An obsession with ‘global warming’ has deleted\\nits values and scrambled its head. I experienced a small example of\\nwhat I mean on a beautiful country walk that I have enjoyed several\\ntimes a week for many years. The path merged into the ﬁelds and\\nforests and you felt at one with the natural world. Then a ‘Green’\\norganisation, the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, took\\nover part of the land and proceeded to cut down a large number of\\ntrees, including mature ones, to install a horrible big, bright steel\\n‘this-is-ours-stay-out’ fence that destroyed the whole atmosphere of\\nthis beautiful place. No one with a feel for nature would do that. Day\\na\\x00er day I walked to the sound of chainsaws and a magniﬁcent\\nmature weeping willow tree that I so admired was cut down at the\\nbase of the trunk. When I challenged a Woke young girl in a green\\nshirt (of course) about this vandalism she replied: ‘It’s a weeping\\nwillow – it will grow back.’ This is what people are paying for when\\nthey donate to the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and\\nmany other ‘green’ organisations today. It is not the environmental\\nmovement that I knew and instead has become a support-system –\\nas with Extinction Rebellion – for a very dark agenda. Private jets for climate justice\\nThe Cult-owned, Gates-funded, World Economic Forum and its\\nfounder Klaus Schwab were behind the emergence of Greta\\nThunberg to harness the young behind the climate agenda and she\\nwas invited to speak to the world at … the UN. Schwab published a\\nbook, Covid-19: The Great Reset in 2020 in which he used the ‘Covid’\\nhoax and the climate hoax to lay out a new society straight out of\\nAgenda 21 and Agenda 2030. Bill Gates followed in early 2021 when\\nhe took time out from destroying the world to produce a book in his\\nname about the way to save it. Gates ﬂies across the world in private\\njets and admi\\x00ed that ‘I probably have one of the highest\\ngreenhouse gas footprints of anyone on the planet … my personal\\nﬂying alone is gigantic.’ He has also bid for the planet’s biggest\\nprivate jet operator. Other climate change saviours who ﬂy in private\\njets include John Kerry, the US Special Presidential Envoy for\\nClimate, and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, a ‘UN Messenger of Peace\\nwith special focus on climate change’. These people are so full of\\nbullshit they could corner the market in manure. We mustn’t be\\nsceptical, though, because the Gates book, How to Avoid a Climate\\nDisaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need, is a\\ngenuine a\\x00empt to protect the world and not an obvious pile of\\nexcrement a\\x00ributed to a mega-psychopath aimed at selling his\\nmasters’ plans for humanity. The Gates book and the other shite-pile\\nby Klaus Schwab could have been wri\\x00en by the same person and\\nmay well have been. Both use ‘climate change’ and ‘Covid’ as the\\nexcuses for their new society and by coincidence the Cult’s World\\nEconomic Forum and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation promote\\nthe climate hoax and hosted Event 201 which pre-empted with a\\n‘simulation’ the very ‘coronavirus’ hoax that would be simulated for\\nreal on humanity within weeks. The British ‘royal’ family is\\npromoting the ‘Reset’ as you would expect through Prince ‘climate\\nchange caused the war in Syria’ Charles and his hapless son Prince\\nWilliam who said that we must ‘reset our relationship with nature\\nand our trajectory as a species’ to avoid a climate disaster. Amazing\\nhow many promotors of the ‘Covid’ and ‘climate change’ control systems are connected to Gates and the World Economic Forum. A\\n‘study’ in early 2021 claimed that carbon dioxide emissions must fall\\nby the equivalent of a global lockdown roughly every two years for\\nthe next decade to save the planet. The ‘study’ appeared in the same\\nperiod that the Schwab mob claimed in a video that lockdowns\\ndestroying the lives of billions are good because they make the earth\\n‘quieter’ with less ‘ambient noise’. They took down the video amid a\\npublic backlash for such arrogant, empathy-deleted stupidity You\\nsee, however, where they are going with this. Corinne Le Quéré, a\\nprofessor at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research,\\nUniversity of East Anglia, was lead author of the climate lockdown\\nstudy, and she writes for … the World Economic Forum. Gates calls\\nin ‘his’ book for changing ‘every aspect of the economy’ (long-time\\nCult agenda) and for humans to eat synthetic ‘meat’ (predicted in\\nmy books) while cows and other farm animals are eliminated.\\nAustralian TV host and commentator Alan Jones described what\\ncarbon emission targets would mean for farm animals in Australia\\nalone if emissions were reduced as demanded by 35 percent by 2030\\nand zero by 2050:\\nWell, let’s take agriculture, the total emissions from agriculture are about 75 million tonnes of\\ncarbon dioxide, equivalent. Now reduce that by 35 percent and you have to come down to\\n50 million tonnes, I’ve done the maths. So if you take for example 1.5 million cows, you’re\\ngoing to have to reduce the herd by 525,000 [by] 2030, nine years, that’s 58,000 cows a year.\\nThe beef herd’s 30 million, reduce that by 35 percent, that’s 10.5 million, which means 1.2\\nmillion cattle have to go every year between now and 2030. This is insanity!\\nThere are 75 million sheep. Reduce that by 35 percent, that’s 26 million sheep, that’s almost 3\\nmillion a year. So under the Paris Agreement over 30 million beasts. dairy cows, cattle, pigs\\nand sheep would go. More than 8,000 every minute of every hour for the next decade, do\\nthese people know what they’re talking about?\\nClearly they don’t at the level of campaigners, politicians and\\nadministrators. The Cult does know; that’s the outcome it wants. We\\nare faced with not just a war on humanity. Animals and the natural\\nworld are being targeted and I have been saying since the ‘Covid’\\nhoax began that the plan eventually was to claim that the ‘deadly\\nvirus’ is able to jump from animals, including farm animals and domestic pets, to humans. Just before this book went into production\\ncame this story: ‘Russia registers world’s ﬁrst Covid-19 vaccine for\\ncats & dogs as makers of Sputnik V warn pets & farm animals could\\nspread virus’. The report said ‘top scientists warned that the deadly\\npathogen could soon begin spreading through homes and farms’\\nand ‘the next stage is the infection of farm and domestic animals’.\\nKnow the outcome and you’ll see the journey. Think what that\\nwould mean for animals and keep your eye on a term called\\nzoonosis or zoonotic diseases which transmit between animals and\\nhumans. The Cult wants to break the connection between animals\\nand people as it does between people and people. Farm animals ﬁt\\nwith the Cult agenda to transform food from natural to synthetic.\\nThe gas of life is killing us\\nThere can be few greater examples of Cult inversion than the\\ncondemnation of carbon dioxide as a dangerous pollutant when it is\\nthe gas of life. Without it the natural world would be dead and so we\\nwould all be dead. We breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon\\ndioxide while plants produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide. It\\nis a perfect symbiotic relationship that the Cult wants to dismantle\\nfor reasons I will come to in the ﬁnal two chapters. Gates, Schwab,\\nother Cult operatives and mindless repeaters, want the world to be\\n‘carbon neutral’ by at least 2050 and the earlier the be\\x00er. ‘Zero\\ncarbon’ is the cry echoed by lunatics calling for ‘Zero Covid’ when\\nwe already have it. These carbon emission targets will\\ndeindustrialise the world in accordance with Cult plans – the post-\\nindustrial, post-democratic society – and with so-called renewables\\nlike solar and wind not coming even close to meeting human energy\\nneeds blackouts and cold are inevitable. Texans got the picture in the\\nwinter of 2021 when a snow storm stopped wind turbines and solar\\npanels from working and the lights went down along with water\\nwhich relies on electricity for its supply system. Gates wants\\neverything to be powered by electricity to ensure that his masters\\nhave the kill switch to stop all human activity, movement, cooking,\\nwater and warmth any time they like. The climate lie is so stupendously inverted that it claims we must urgently reduce\\ncarbon dioxide when we don’t have enough.\\nCo2 in the atmosphere is a li\\x00le above 400 parts per million when\\nthe optimum for plant growth is 2,000 ppm and when it falls\\nanywhere near 150 ppm the natural world starts to die and so do we.\\nIt fell to as low as 280 ppm in an 1880 measurement in Hawaii and\\nrose to 413 ppm in 2019 with industrialisation which is why the\\nplanet has become greener in the industrial period. How insane then\\nthat psychopathic madman Gates is not satisﬁed only with blocking\\nthe rise of Co2. He’s funding technology to suck it out of the\\natmosphere. The reason why will become clear. The industrial era is\\nnot destroying the world through Co2 and has instead turned\\naround a potentially disastrous ongoing fall in Co2. Greenpeace co-\\nfounder and scientist Patrick Moore walked away from Greenpeace\\nin 1986 and has exposed the green movement for fear-mongering\\nand lies. He said that 500 million years ago there was 17 times more\\nCo2 in the atmosphere than we have today and levels have been\\nfalling for hundreds of millions of years. In the last 150 million years\\nCo2 levels in Earth’s atmosphere had reduced by 90 percent. Moore\\nsaid that by the time humanity began to unlock carbon dioxide from\\nfossil fuels we were at ‘38 seconds to midnight’ and in that sense:\\n‘Humans are [the Earth’s] salvation.’ Moore made the point that only\\nhalf the Co2 emi\\x00ed by fossil fuels stays in the atmosphere and we\\nshould remember that all pollution pouring from chimneys that we\\nare told is carbon dioxide is in fact nothing of the kind. It’s pollution.\\nCarbon dioxide is an invisible gas.\\nWilliam Happer, Professor of Physics at Princeton University and\\nlong-time government adviser on climate, has emphasised the Co2\\ndeﬁciency for maximum growth and food production. Greenhouse\\ngrowers don’t add carbon dioxide for a bit of fun. He said that most\\nof the warming in the last 100 years, a\\x00er the earth emerged from\\nthe super-cold period of the ‘Li\\x00le Ice Age’ into a natural warming\\ncycle, was over by 1940. Happer said that a peak year for warming in\\n1988 can be explained by a ‘monster El Nino’ which is a natural and\\ncyclical warming of the Paciﬁc that has nothing to do with ‘climate change’. He said the eﬀect of Co2 could be compared to painting a\\nwall with red paint in that once two or three coats have been applied\\nit didn’t ma\\x00er how much more you slapped on because the wall\\nwill not get much redder. Almost all the eﬀect of the rise in Co2 has\\nalready happened, he said, and the volume in the atmosphere would\\nnow have to double to increase temperature by a single degree.\\nClimate hoaxers know this and they have invented the most\\nridiculously complicated series of ‘feedback’ loops to try to\\novercome this rather devastating fact. You hear puppet Greta going\\non cluelessly about feedback loops and this is why.\\nThe Sun affects temperature? No you climate denier\\nSome other nonsense to contemplate: Climate graphs show that rises\\nin temperature do not follow rises in Co2 – it’s the other way round\\nwith a lag between the two of some 800 years. If we go back 800\\nyears from present time we hit the Medieval Warm Period when\\ntemperatures were higher than now without any industrialisation\\nand this was followed by the Li\\x00le Ice Age when temperatures\\nplummeted. The world was still emerging from these centuries of\\nserious cold when many climate records began which makes the\\never-repeated line of the ‘ho\\x00est year since records began’\\nmeaningless when you are not comparing like with like. The coldest\\nperiod of the Li\\x00le Ice Age corresponded with the lowest period of\\nsunspot activity when the Sun was at its least active. Proper\\nscientists will not be at all surprised by this when it conﬁrms the\\nobvious fact that earth temperature is aﬀected by the scale of Sun\\nactivity and the energetic power that it subsequently emits; but\\nwhen is the last time you heard a climate hoaxer talking about the\\nSun as a source of earth temperature?? Everything has to be focussed\\non Co2 which makes up just 0.117 percent of so-called greenhouse\\ngases and only a fraction of even that is generated by human activity.\\nThe rest is natural. More than 90 percent of those greenhouse gases\\nare water vapour and clouds (Fig 9). Ban moisture I say. Have you\\nnoticed that the climate hoaxers no longer use the polar bear as their\\npromotion image? That’s because far from becoming extinct polar bear communities are stable or thriving. Joe Bastardi, American\\nmeteorologist, weather forecaster and outspoken critic of the climate\\nlie, documents in his book The Climate Chronicles how weather\\npa\\x00erns and events claimed to be evidence of climate change have\\nbeen happening since long before industrialisation: ‘What happened\\nbefore naturally is happening again, as is to be expected given the\\ncyclical nature of the climate due to the design of the planet.’ If you\\nread the detailed background to the climate hoax in my other books\\nyou will shake your head and wonder how anyone could believe the\\ncrap which has spawned a multi-trillion dollar industry based on\\nabsolute garbage (see HIV causes AIDs and Sars-Cov-2 causes\\n‘Covid-19’). Climate and ‘Covid’ have much in common given they\\nhave the same source. They both have the contradictory everything\\nfactor in which everything is explained by reference to them. It’s hot\\n– ‘it’s climate change’. It’s cold – ‘it’s climate change’. I got a sniﬄe –\\n‘it’s Covid’. I haven’t got a sniﬄe – ‘it’s Covid’. Not having a sniﬄe\\nhas to be a symptom of ‘Covid’. Everything is and not having a\\nsniﬄe is especially dangerous if you are a slow walker. For sheer\\naudacity I oﬀer you a Cambridge University ‘study’ that actually\\nlinked ‘Covid’ to ‘climate change’. It had to happen eventually. They\\nconcluded that climate change played a role in ‘Covid-19’ spreading\\nfrom animals to humans because … wait for it … I kid you not … the\\ntwo groups were forced closer together as populations grow. Er, that’s it.\\nThe whole foundation on which this depended was that ‘Bats are the\\nlikely zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2’. Well, they\\nare not. They are nothing to do with it. Apart from bats not being the\\norigin and therefore ‘climate change’ eﬀects on bats being irrelevant\\nI am in awe of their academic insight. Where would we be without\\nthem? Not where we are that’s for sure. Figure 9: The idea that the gas of life is disastrously changing the climate is an insult to brain\\ncell activity.\\nOne other point about the weather is that climate modiﬁcation is\\nnow well advanced and not every major weather event is natural –\\nor earthquake come to that. I cover this subject at some length in\\nother books. China is openly planning a rapid expansion of its\\nweather modiﬁcation programme which includes changing the\\nclimate in an area more than one and a half times the size of India.\\nChina used weather manipulation to ensure clear skies during the\\n2008 Olympics in Beĳing. I have quoted from US military documents\\ndetailing how to employ weather manipulation as a weapon of war\\nand they did that in the 1960s and 70s during the conﬂict in Vietnam\\nwith Operation Popeye manipulating monsoon rains for military\\npurposes. Why would there be international treaties on weather\\nmodiﬁcation if it wasn’t possible? Of course it is. Weather is\\nenergetic information and it can be changed.\\nHow was the climate hoax pulled off? See ‘Covid’\\nIf you can get billions to believe in a ‘virus’ that doesn’t exist you can\\nget them to believe in human-caused climate change that doesn’t\\nexist. Both are being used by the Cult to transform global society in\\nthe way it has long planned. Both hoaxes have been achieved in\\npre\\x00y much the same way. First you declare a lie is a fact. There’s a ‘virus’ you call SARS-Cov-2 or humans are warming the planet with\\ntheir behaviour. Next this becomes, via Cult networks, the\\nfoundation of government, academic and science policy and belief.\\nThose who parrot the mantra are given big grants to produce\\nresearch that conﬁrms the narrative is true and ever more\\n‘symptoms’ are added to make the ‘virus’/’climate change’ sound\\neven more scary. Scientists and researchers who challenge the\\nnarrative have their grants withdrawn and their careers destroyed.\\nThe media promote the lie as the unquestionable truth and censor\\nthose with an alternative view or evidence. A great percentage of the\\npopulation believe what they are told as the lie becomes an\\neverybody-knows-that and the believing-masses turn on those with\\na mind of their own. The technique has been used endlessly\\nthroughout human history. Wokers are the biggest promotors of the\\nclimate lie and ‘Covid’ fascism because their minds are owned by the\\nCult; their sense of self-righteous self-purity knows no bounds; and\\nthey exist in a bubble of reality in which facts are irrelevant and only\\nget in the way of looking without seeing.\\nRunning through all of this like veins in a blue cheese is control of\\ninformation, which means control of perception, which means\\ncontrol of behaviour, which collectively means control of human\\nsociety. The Cult owns the global media and Silicon Valley fascists\\nfor the simple reason that it has to. Without control of information it\\ncan’t control perception and through that human society. Examine\\nevery facet of the Cult agenda and you will see that anything\\nsupporting its introduction is never censored while anything\\npushing back is always censored. I say again: Psychopaths that know\\nwhy they are doing this must go before Nuremberg trials and those\\nthat follow their orders must trot along behind them into the same\\ndock. ‘I was just following orders’ didn’t work the ﬁrst time and it\\nmust not work now. Nuremberg trials must be held all over the\\nworld before public juries for politicians, government oﬃcials,\\npolice, compliant doctors, scientists and virologists, and all Cult\\noperatives such as Gates, Tedros, Fauci, Vallance, Whi\\x00y, Ferguson,\\nZuckerberg, Wojcicki, Brin, Page, Dorsey, the whole damn lot of them – including, no especially, the psychopath psychologists.\\nWithout them and the brainless, gutless excuses for journalists that\\nhave repeated their lies, none of this could be happening. Nobody\\ncan be allowed to escape justice for the psychological and economic\\nArmageddon they are all responsible for visiting upon the human\\nrace.\\nAs for the compliant, unquestioning, swathes of humanity, and the\\nself-obsessed, all-knowing ignorance of the Wokers … don’t start me.\\nGod help their kids. God help their grandkids. God help them. I\\nCHAPTER NINE\\nWe must have it? So what is it?\\nWell I won’t back down. No, I won’t back down. You can stand me\\nup at the Gates of Hell. But I won’t back down\\nTom Petty\\nwill now focus on the genetically-manipulating ‘Covid vaccines’\\nwhich do not meet this oﬃcial deﬁnition of a vaccine by the US\\nCenters for Disease Control (CDC): ‘A product that stimulates a\\nperson’s immune system to produce immunity to a speciﬁc disease,\\nprotecting the person from that disease.’ On that basis ‘Covid\\nvaccines’ are not a vaccine in that the makers don’t even claim they\\nstop infection or transmission.\\nThey are instead part of a multi-levelled conspiracy to change the\\nnature of the human body and what it means to be ‘human’ and to\\ndepopulate an enormous swathe of humanity. What I shall call\\nHuman 1.0 is on the cusp of becoming Human 2.0 and for very\\nsinister reasons. Before I get to the ‘Covid vaccine’ in detail here’s\\nsome background to vaccines in general. Government regulators do\\nnot test vaccines – the makers do – and the makers control which\\ndata is revealed and which isn’t. Children in America are given 50\\nvaccine doses by age six and 69 by age 19 and the eﬀect of the whole\\ncombined schedule has never been tested. Autoimmune diseases\\nwhen the immune system a\\x00acks its own body have soared in the\\nmass vaccine era and so has disease in general in children and the\\nyoung. Why wouldn’t this be the case when vaccines target the\\nimmune system? The US government gave Big Pharma drug companies immunity from prosecution for vaccine death and injury\\nin the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) and\\nsince then the government (taxpayer) has been funding\\ncompensation for the consequences of Big Pharma vaccines. The\\ncriminal and satanic drug giants can’t lose and the vaccine schedule\\nhas increased dramatically since 1986 for this reason. There is no\\nincentive to make vaccines safe and a big incentive to make money\\nby introducing ever more. Even against a ridiculously high bar to\\nprove vaccine liability, and with the government controlling the\\nhearing in which it is being challenged for compensation, the vaccine\\ncourt has so far paid out more than $4 billion. These are the vaccines\\nwe are told are safe and psychopaths like Zuckerberg censor posts\\nsaying otherwise. The immunity law was even justiﬁed by a ruling\\nthat vaccines by their nature were ‘unavoidably unsafe’.\\nCheck out the ingredients of vaccines and you will be shocked if\\nyou are new to this. They put that in children’s bodies?? What?? Try\\naluminium, a brain toxin connected to dementia, aborted foetal\\ntissue and formaldehyde which is used to embalm corpses. World-\\nrenowned aluminium expert Christopher Exley had his research into\\nthe health eﬀect of aluminium in vaccines shut down by Keele\\nUniversity in the UK when it began taking funding from the Bill and\\nMelinda Gates Foundation. Research when diseases ‘eradicated’ by\\nvaccines began to decline and you will ﬁnd the fall began long before\\nthe vaccine was introduced. Sometimes the fall even plateaued a\\x00er\\nthe vaccine. Diseases like scarlet fever for which there was no\\nvaccine declined in the same way because of environmental and\\nother factors. A perfect case in point is the polio vaccine. Polio began\\nwhen lead arsenate was ﬁrst sprayed as an insecticide and residues\\nremained in food products. Spraying started in 1892 and the ﬁrst US\\npolio epidemic came in Vermont in 1894. The simple answer was to\\nstop spraying, but Rockefeller-created Big Pharma had a be\\x00er idea.\\nPolio was decreed to be caused by the poliovirus which ‘spreads from\\nperson to person and can infect a person’s spinal cord’. Lead\\narsenate was replaced by the lethal DDT which had the same eﬀect\\nof causing paralysis by damaging the brain and central nervous system. Polio plummeted when DDT was reduced and then banned,\\nbut the vaccine is still given the credit for something it didn’t do.\\nToday by far the biggest cause of polio is the vaccines promoted by\\nBill Gates. Vaccine justice campaigner Robert Kennedy Jr, son of\\nassassinated (by the Cult) US A\\x00orney General Robert Kennedy,\\nwrote:\\nIn 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reluctantly admitted that the global explosion\\nin polio is predominantly vaccine strain. The most frightening epidemics in Congo,\\nAfghanistan, and the Philippines, are all linked to vaccines. In fact, by 2018, 70% of global\\npolio cases were vaccine strain.\\nVaccines make fortunes for Cult-owned Gates and Big Pharma\\nwhile undermining the health and immune systems of the\\npopulation. We had a glimpse of the mentality behind the Big\\nPharma cartel with a report on WION (World is One News), an\\ninternational English language TV station based in India, which\\nexposed the extraordinary behaviour of US drug company Pﬁzer\\nover its ‘Covid vaccine’. The WION report told how Pﬁzer had made\\nfantastic demands of Argentina, Brazil and other countries in return\\nfor its ‘vaccine’. These included immunity from prosecution, even\\nfor Pﬁzer negligence, government insurance to protect Pﬁzer from\\nlaw suits and handing over as collateral sovereign assets of the\\ncountry to include Argentina’s bank reserves, military bases and\\nembassy buildings. Pﬁzer demanded the same of Brazil in the form\\nof waiving sovereignty of its assets abroad; exempting Pﬁzer from\\nBrazilian laws; and giving Pﬁzer immunity from all civil liability.\\nThis is a ‘vaccine’ developed with government funding. Big Pharma\\nis evil incarnate as a creation of the Cult and all must be handed\\ntickets to Nuremberg.\\nPhantom ‘vaccine’ for a phantom ‘disease’\\nI’ll expose the ‘Covid vaccine’ fraud and then go on to the wider\\nbackground of why the Cult has set out to ‘vaccinate’ every man,\\nwoman and child on the planet for an alleged ‘new disease’ with a\\nsurvival rate of 99.77 percent (or more) even by the grotesquely- manipulated ﬁgures of the World Health Organization and Johns\\nHopkins University. The ‘infection’ to ‘death’ ratio is 0.23 to 0.15\\npercent according to Stanford epidemiologist Dr John Ioannidis and\\nwhile estimates vary the danger remains tiny. I say that if the truth\\nbe told the fake infection to fake death ratio is zero. Never mind all\\nthe evidence I have presented here and in The Answer that there is no\\n‘virus’ let us just focus for a moment on that death-rate ﬁgure of say\\n0.23 percent. The ﬁgure includes all those worldwide who have\\ntested positive with a test not testing for the ‘virus’ and then died\\nwithin 28 days or even longer of any other cause – any other cause.\\nNow subtract all those illusory ‘Covid’ deaths on the global data\\nsheets from the 0.23 percent. What do you think you would be le\\x00\\nwith? Zero. A vaccination has never been successfully developed for\\na so-called coronavirus. They have all failed at the animal testing\\nstage when they caused hypersensitivity to what they were claiming\\nto protect against and made the impact of a disease far worse. Cult-\\nowned vaccine corporations got around that problem this time by\\nbypassing animal trials, going straight to humans and making the\\nlength of the ‘trials’ before the public rollout as short as they could\\nget away with. Normally it takes ﬁve to ten years or more to develop\\nvaccines that still cause demonstrable harm to many people and\\nthat’s without including the long-term eﬀects that are never oﬃcially\\nconnected to the vaccination. ‘Covid’ non-vaccines have been\\noﬃcially produced and approved in a ma\\x00er of months from a\\nstanding start and part of the reason is that (a) they were developed\\nbefore the ‘Covid’ hoax began and (b) they are based on computer\\nprograms and not natural sources. Oﬃcial non-trials were so short\\nthat government agencies gave emergency, not full, approval. ‘Trials’\\nwere not even completed and full approval cannot be secured until\\nthey are. Public ‘Covid vaccination’ is actually a continuation of the\\ntrial. Drug company ‘trials’ are not scheduled to end until 2023 by\\nwhich time a lot of people are going to be dead. Data on which\\ngovernment agencies gave this emergency approval was supplied by\\nthe Big Pharma corporations themselves in the form of\\nPﬁzer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others, and this is the case with all vaccines. By its very nature\\nemergency approval means drug companies do not have to prove that\\nthe ‘vaccine’ is ‘safe and eﬀective’. How could they with trials way\\nshort of complete? Government regulators only have to believe that\\nthey could be safe and eﬀective. It is criminal manipulation to get\\nproducts in circulation with no testing worth the name. Agencies\\ngiving that approval are infested with Big Pharma-connected place-\\npeople and they act in the interests of Big Pharma (the Cult) and not\\nthe public about whom they do not give a damn.\\nMore human lab rats\\n‘Covid vaccines’ produced in record time by Pﬁzer/BioNTech and\\nModerna employ a technique never approved before for use on humans.\\nThey are known as mRNA ‘vaccines’ and inject a synthetic version of\\n‘viral’ mRNA or ‘messenger RNA’. The key is in the term\\n‘messenger’. The body works, or doesn’t, on the basis of information\\nmessaging. Communications are constantly passing between and\\nwithin the genetic system and the brain. Change those messages and\\nyou change the state of the body and even its very nature and you\\ncan change psychology and behaviour by the way the brain\\nprocesses information. I think you are going to see signiﬁcant\\nchanges in personality and perception of many people who have had\\nthe ‘Covid vaccine’ synthetic potions. Insider Aldous Huxley\\npredicted the following in 1961 and mRNA ‘vaccines’ can be\\nincluded in the term ‘pharmacological methods’:\\nThere will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people love\\ntheir servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of\\npainless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their own\\nliberties taken away from them, but rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any\\ndesire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by\\npharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution.\\nApologists claim that mRNA synthetic ‘vaccines’ don’t change the\\nDNA genetic blueprint because RNA does not aﬀect DNA only the\\nother way round. This is so disingenuous. A process called ‘reverse transcription’ can convert RNA into DNA and be integrated into\\nDNA in the cell nucleus. This was highlighted in December, 2020, by\\nscientists at Harvard and Massachuse\\x00s Institute of Technology\\n(MIT). Geneticists report that more than 40 percent of mammalian\\ngenomes results from reverse transcription. On the most basic level\\nif messaging changes then that sequence must lead to changes in\\nDNA which is receiving and transmi\\x00ing those communications.\\nHow can introducing synthetic material into cells not change the\\ncells where DNA is located? The process is known as transfection\\nwhich is deﬁned as ‘a technique to insert foreign nucleic acid (DNA\\nor RNA) into a cell, typically with the intention of altering the\\nproperties of the cell’. Researchers at the Sloan Ke\\x00ering Institute in\\nNew York found that changes in messenger RNA can deactivate\\ntumour-suppressing proteins and thereby promote cancer. This is\\nwhat happens when you mess with messaging. ‘Covid vaccine’\\nmaker Moderna was founded in 2010 by Canadian stem cell\\nbiologist Derrick J. Rossi a\\x00er his breakthrough discovery in the ﬁeld\\nof transforming and reprogramming stem cells. These are neutral\\ncells that can be programmed to become any cell including sperm\\ncells. Moderna was therefore founded on the principle of genetic\\nmanipulation and has never produced any vaccine or drug before its\\ngenetically-manipulating synthetic ‘Covid’ shite. Look at the name –\\nMode-RNA or Modify-RNA. Another important point is that the US\\nSupreme Court has ruled that genetically-modiﬁed DNA, or\\ncomplementary DNA (cDNA) synthesized in the laboratory from\\nmessenger RNA, can be patented and owned. These psychopaths are\\ndoing this to the human body.\\nCells replicate synthetic mRNA in the ‘Covid vaccines’ and in\\ntheory the body is tricked into making antigens which trigger\\nantibodies to target the ‘virus spike proteins’ which as Dr Tom\\nCowan said have never been seen. Cut the crap and these ‘vaccines’\\ndeliver self-replicating synthetic material to the cells with the eﬀect of\\nchanging human DNA. The more of them you have the more that\\nprocess is compounded while synthetic material is all the time self-\\nreplicating. ‘Vaccine’-maker Moderna describes mRNA as ‘like so\\x00ware for the cell’ and so they are messing with the body’s\\nso\\x00ware. What happens when you change the so\\x00ware in a\\ncomputer? Everything changes. For this reason the Cult is preparing\\na production line of mRNA ‘Covid vaccines’ and a long list of\\nexcuses to use them as with all the ‘variants’ of a ‘virus’ never shown\\nto exist. The plan is further to transfer the mRNA technique to other\\nvaccines mostly given to children and young people. The cumulative\\nconsequences will be a transformation of human DNA through a\\nconstant infusion of synthetic genetic material which will kill many\\nand change the rest. Now consider that governments that have given\\nemergency approval for a vaccine that’s not a vaccine; never been\\napproved for humans before; had no testing worth the name; and\\nthe makers have been given immunity from prosecution for any\\ndeaths or adverse eﬀects suﬀered by the public. The UK government\\nawarded permanent legal indemnity to itself and its employees for\\nharm done when a patient is being treated for ‘Covid-19’ or\\n‘suspected Covid-19’. That is quite a thought when these are possible\\n‘side-eﬀects’ from the ‘vaccine’ (they are not ‘side’, they are eﬀects)\\nlisted by the US Food and Drug Administration:\\nGuillain-Barre syndrome; acute disseminated encephalomyelitis;\\ntransverse myelitis; encephalitis; myelitis; encephalomyelitis;\\nmeningoencephalitis; meningitis; encephalopathy; convulsions;\\nseizures; stroke; narcolepsy; cataplexy; anaphylaxis; acute\\nmyocardial infarction (heart a\\x00ack); myocarditis; pericarditis;\\nautoimmune disease; death; implications for pregnancy, and birth\\noutcomes; other acute demyelinating diseases; non anaphylactic\\nallergy reactions; thrombocytopenia ; disseminated intravascular\\ncoagulation; venous thromboembolism; arthritis; arthralgia; joint\\npain; Kawasaki disease; multisystem inﬂammatory syndrome in\\nchildren; vaccine enhanced disease. The la\\x00er is the way the\\n‘vaccine’ has the potential to make diseases far worse than they\\nwould otherwise be. UK doctor and freedom campaigner Vernon Coleman described\\nthe conditions in this list as ‘all unpleasant, most of them very\\nserious, and you can’t get more serious than death’. The thought that\\nanyone at all has had the ‘vaccine’ in these circumstances is\\ntestament to the potential that humanity has for clueless,\\nunquestioning, stupidity and for many that programmed stupidity\\nhas already been terminal.\\nAn insider speaks\\nDr Michael Yeadon is a former Vice President, head of research and\\nChief Scientiﬁc Adviser at vaccine giant Pﬁzer. Yeadon worked on\\nthe inside of Big Pharma, but that did not stop him becoming a vocal\\ncritic of ‘Covid vaccines’ and their potential for multiple harms,\\nincluding infertility in women. By the spring of 2021 he went much\\nfurther and even used the no, no, term ‘conspiracy’. When you begin\\nto see what is going on it is impossible not to do so. Yeadon spoke\\nout in an interview with freedom campaigner James Delingpole and\\nI mentioned earlier how he said that no one had samples of ‘the\\nvirus’. He explained that the mRNA technique originated in the anti-\\ncancer ﬁeld and ways to turn on and oﬀ certain genes which could\\nbe advantageous if you wanted to stop cancer growing out of\\ncontrol. ‘That’s the origin of them. They are a very unusual\\napplication, really.’ Yeadon said that treating a cancer patient with\\nan aggressive procedure might be understandable if the alternative\\nwas dying, but it was quite another thing to use the same technique\\nas a public health measure. Most people involved wouldn’t catch the\\ninfectious agent you were vaccinating against and if they did they\\nprobably wouldn’t die:\\nIf you are really using it as a public health measure you really want to as close as you can get\\nto zero sides-effects … I find it odd that they chose techniques that were really cutting their\\nteeth in the field of oncology and I’m worried that in using gene-based vaccines that have to\\nbe injected in the body and spread around the body, get taken up into some cells, and the\\nregulators haven’t quite told us which cells they get taken up into … you are going to be\\ngenerating a wide range of responses … with multiple steps each of which could go well or\\nbadly. I doubt the Cult intends it to go well. Yeadon said that you can put\\nany gene you like into the body through the ‘vaccine’. ‘You can\\ncertainly give them a gene that would do them some harm if you\\nwanted.’ I was intrigued when he said that when used in the cancer\\nﬁeld the technique could turn genes on and oﬀ. I explore this process\\nin The Answer and with diﬀerent genes having diﬀerent functions\\nyou could create mayhem – physically and psychologically – if you\\nturned the wrong ones on and the right ones oﬀ. I read reports of an\\nexperiment by researchers at the University of Washington’s school\\nof computer science and engineering in which they encoded DNA to\\ninfect computers. The body is itself a biological computer and if\\nhuman DNA can inﬂict damage on a computer why can’t the\\ncomputer via synthetic material mess with the human body? It can.\\nThe Washington research team said it was possible to insert\\nmalicious malware into ‘physical DNA strands’ and corrupt the\\ncomputer system of a gene sequencing machine as it ‘reads gene\\nle\\x00ers and stores them as binary digits 0 and 1’. They concluded that\\nhackers could one day use blood or spit samples to access computer\\nsystems and obtain sensitive data from police forensics labs or infect\\ngenome ﬁles. It is at this level of digital interaction that synthetic\\n‘vaccines’ need to be seen to get the full picture and that will become\\nvery clear later on. Michael Yeadon said it made no sense to give the\\n‘vaccine’ to younger people who were in no danger from the ‘virus’.\\nWhat was the beneﬁt? It was all downside with potential eﬀects:\\nThe fact that my government in what I thought was a civilised, rational country, is raining [the\\n‘vaccine’] on people in their 30s and 40s, even my children in their 20s, they’re getting letters\\nand phone calls, I know this is not right and any of you doctors who are vaccinating you\\nknow it’s not right, too. They are not at risk. They are not at risk from the disease, so you are\\nnow hoping that the side-effects are so rare that you get away with it. You don’t give new\\ntechnology … that you don’t understand to 100 percent of the population.\\nBlood clot problems with the AstraZeneca ‘vaccine’ have been\\naﬀecting younger people to emphasise the downside risks with no\\nbeneﬁt. AstraZeneca’s version, produced with Oxford University,\\ndoes not use mRNA, but still gets its toxic cocktail inside cells where it targets DNA. The Johnson & Johnson ‘vaccine’ which uses a\\nsimilar technique has also produced blood clot eﬀects to such an\\nextent that the United States paused its use at one point. They are all\\n‘gene therapy’ (cell modiﬁcation) procedures and not ‘vaccines’. The\\ntruth is that once the content of these injections enter cells we have\\nno idea what the eﬀect will be. People can speculate and some can\\ngive very educated opinions and that’s good. In the end, though,\\nonly the makers know what their potions are designed to do and\\neven they won’t know every last consequence. Michael Yeadon was\\nscathing about doctors doing what they knew to be wrong.\\n‘Everyone’s mute’, he said. Doctors in the NHS must know this was\\nnot right, coming into work and injecting people. ‘I don’t know how\\nthey sleep at night. I know I couldn’t do it. I know that if I were in\\nthat position I’d have to quit.’ He said he knew enough about\\ntoxicology to know this was not a good risk-beneﬁt. Yeadon had\\nspoken to seven or eight university professors and all except two\\nwould not speak out publicly. Their universities had a policy that no\\none said anything that countered the government and its medical\\nadvisors. They were afraid of losing their government grants. This is\\nhow intimidation has been used to silence the truth at every level of\\nthe system. I say silence, but these people could still speak out if they\\nmade that choice. Yeadon called them ‘moral cowards’ – ‘This is\\nabout your children and grandchildren’s lives and you have just\\nbuggered oﬀ and le\\x00 it.’\\n‘Variant’ nonsense\\nSome of his most powerful comments related to the alleged\\n‘variants’ being used to instil more fear, justify more lockdowns, and\\nintroduce more ‘vaccines’. He said government claims about\\n‘variants’ were nonsense. He had checked the alleged variant ‘codes’\\nand they were 99.7 percent identical to the ‘original’. This was the\\nhuman identity diﬀerence equivalent to pu\\x00ing a baseball cap on\\nand oﬀ or wearing it the other way round. A 0.3 percent diﬀerence\\nwould make it impossible for that ‘variant’ to escape immunity from\\nthe ‘original’. This made no sense of having new ‘vaccines’ for ‘variants’. He said there would have to be at least a 30 percent\\ndiﬀerence for that to be justiﬁed and even then he believed the\\nimmune system would still recognise what it was. Gates-funded\\n‘variant modeller’ and ‘vaccine’-pusher John Edmunds might care to\\ncomment. Yeadon said drug companies were making new versions\\nof the ‘vaccine’ as a ‘top up’ for ‘variants’. Worse than that, he said,\\nthe ‘regulators’ around the world like the MHRA in the UK had got\\ntogether and agreed that because ‘vaccines’ for ‘variants’ were so\\nsimilar to the ﬁrst ‘vaccines’ they did not have to do safety studies. How\\ntransparently sinister that is. This is when Yeadon said: ‘There is a\\nconspiracy here.’ There was no need for another vaccine for\\n‘variants’ and yet we were told that there was and the country had\\nshut its borders because of them. ‘They are going into hundreds of\\nmillions of arms without passing ‘go’ or any regulator. Why did they\\ndo that? Why did they pick this method of making the vaccine?’\\nThe reason had to be something bigger than that it seemed and\\n‘it’s not protection against the virus’. It’s was a far bigger project that\\nmeant politicians and advisers were willing to do things and not do\\nthings that knowingly resulted in avoidable deaths – ‘that’s already\\nhappened when you think about lockdown and deprivation of\\nhealth care for a year.’ He spoke of people prepared to do something\\nthat results in the avoidable death of their fellow human beings and\\nit not bother them. This is the penny-drop I have been working to\\nget across for more than 30 years – the level of pure evil we are\\ndealing with. Yeadon said his friends and associates could not\\nbelieve there could be that much evil, but he reminded them of\\nStalin, Pol Pot and Hitler and of what Stalin had said: ‘One death is a\\ntragedy. A million? A statistic.’ He could not think of a benign\\nexplanation for why you need top-up vaccines ‘which I’m sure you\\ndon’t’ and for the regulators ‘to just get out of the way and wave\\nthem through’. Why would the regulators do that when they were\\nstill wrestling with the dangers of the ‘parent’ vaccine? He was\\nclearly shocked by what he had seen since the ‘Covid’ hoax began\\nand now he was thinking the previously unthinkable: If you wanted to depopulate a significant proportion of the world and to do it in a way that\\ndoesn’t involve destruction of the environment with nuclear weapons, poisoning everyone\\nwith anthrax or something like that, and you wanted plausible deniability while you had a\\nmulti-year infectious disease crisis, I actually don’t think you could come up with a better plan\\nof work than seems to be in front of me. I can’t say that’s what they are going to do, but I can’t\\nthink of a benign explanation why they are doing it.\\nHe said he never thought that they would get rid of 99 percent of\\nhumans, but now he wondered. ‘If you wanted to that this would be\\na hell of a way to do it – it would be unstoppable folks.’ Yeadon had\\nconcluded that those who submi\\x00ed to the ‘vaccine’ would be\\nallowed to have some kind of normal life (but for how long?) while\\nscrews were tightened to coerce and mandate the last few percent. ‘I\\nthink they’ll put the rest of them in a prison camp. I wish I was\\nwrong, but I don’t think I am.’ Other points he made included: There\\nwere no coronavirus vaccines then suddenly they all come along at\\nthe same time; we have no idea of the long term aﬀect with trials so\\nshort; coercing or forcing people to have medical procedures is\\nagainst the Nuremberg Code instigated when the Nazis did just that;\\npeople should at least delay having the ‘vaccine’; a quick Internet\\nsearch conﬁrms that masks don’t reduce respiratory viral\\ntransmission and ‘the government knows that’; they have smashed\\ncivil society and they know that, too; two dozen peer-reviewed\\nstudies show no connection between lockdown and reducing deaths;\\nhe knew from personal friends the elite were still ﬂying around and\\ngoing on holiday while the public were locked down; the elite were\\nnot having the ‘vaccines’. He was also asked if ‘vaccines’ could be\\nmade to target diﬀerence races. He said he didn’t know, but the\\ndocument by the Project for the New American Century in\\nSeptember, 2000, said developing ‘advanced forms of biological\\nwarfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological\\nwarfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.’ Oh,\\nthey’re evil all right. Of that we can be absolutely sure.\\nAnother cull of old people We have seen from the CDC deﬁnition that the mRNA ‘Covid\\nvaccine’ is not a vaccine and nor are the others that claim to reduce\\n‘severity of symptoms’ in some people, but not protect from infection\\nor transmission. What about all the lies about returning to ‘normal’ if\\npeople were ‘vaccinated’? If they are not claimed to stop infection\\nand transmission of the alleged ‘virus’, how does anything change?\\nThis was all lies to manipulate people to take the jabs and we are\\nseeing that now with masks and distancing still required for the\\n‘vaccinated’. How did they think that elderly people with fragile\\nhealth and immune responses were going to be aﬀected by infusing\\ntheir cells with synthetic material and other toxic substances? They\\nknew that in the short and long term it would be devastating and\\nfatal as the culling of the old that began with the ﬁrst lockdowns was\\ncontinued with the ‘vaccine’. Death rates in care homes soared\\nimmediately residents began to be ‘vaccinated’ – infused with\\nsynthetic material. Brave and commi\\x00ed whistleblower nurses put\\ntheir careers at risk by exposing this truth while the rest kept their\\nheads down and their mouths shut to put their careers before those\\nthey are supposed to care for. A long-time American Certiﬁed\\nNursing Assistant who gave his name as James posted a video in\\nwhich he described emotionally what happened in his care home\\nwhen vaccination began. He said that during 2020 very few residents\\nwere sick with ‘Covid’ and no one died during the entire year; but\\nshortly a\\x00er the Pﬁzer mRNA injections 14 people died within two\\nweeks and many others were near death. ‘They’re dropping like\\nﬂies’, he said. Residents who walked on their own before the shot\\ncould no longer and they had lost their ability to conduct an\\nintelligent conversation. The home’s management said the sudden\\ndeaths were caused by a ‘super-spreader’ of ‘Covid-19’. Then how\\ncome, James asked, that residents who refused to take the injections\\nwere not sick? It was a case of inject the elderly with mRNA\\nsynthetic potions and blame their illness and death that followed on\\nthe ‘virus’. James described what was happening in care homes as\\n‘the greatest crime of genocide this country has ever seen’.\\nRemember the NHS staﬀ nurse from earlier who used the same word ‘genocide’ for what was happening with the ‘vaccines’ and\\nthat it was an ‘act of human annihilation’. A UK care home\\nwhistleblower told a similar story to James about the eﬀect of the\\n‘vaccine’ in deaths and ‘outbreaks’ of illness dubbed ‘Covid’ a\\x00er\\nge\\x00ing the jab. She told how her care home management and staﬀ\\nhad zealously imposed government regulations and no one was\\nallowed to even question the oﬃcial narrative let alone speak out\\nagainst it. She said the NHS was even worse. Again we see the\\nresults of reframing. A worker at a local care home where I live said\\nthey had not had a single case of ‘Covid’ there for almost a year and\\nwhen the residents were ‘vaccinated’ they had 19 positive cases in\\ntwo weeks with eight dying.\\nIt’s not the ‘vaccine’ – honest\\nThe obvious cause and eﬀect was being ignored by the media and\\nmost of the public. Australia’s health minister Greg Hunt (a former\\nhead of strategy at the World Economic Forum) was admi\\x00ed to\\nhospital a\\x00er he had the ‘vaccine’. He was suﬀering according to\\nreports from the skin infection ‘cellulitis’ and it must have been a\\nsevere case to have warranted days in hospital. Immediately the\\nauthorities said this was nothing to do with the ‘vaccine’ when an\\neﬀect of some vaccines is a ‘cellulitis-like reaction’. We had families\\nof perfectly healthy old people who died a\\x00er the ‘vaccine’ saying\\nthat if only they had been given the ‘vaccine’ earlier they would still\\nbe alive. As a numbskull rating that is oﬀ the chart. A father of four\\n‘died of Covid’ at aged 48 when he was taken ill two days a\\x00er\\nhaving the ‘vaccine’. The man, a health administrator, had been\\n‘shielding during the pandemic’ and had ‘not really le\\x00 the house’\\nuntil he went for the ‘vaccine’. Having the ‘vaccine’ and then falling\\nill and dying does not seem to have qualiﬁed as a possible cause and\\neﬀect and ‘Covid-19’ went on his death certiﬁcate. His family said\\nthey had no idea how he ‘caught the virus’. A family member said:\\n‘Tragically, it could be that going for a vaccination ultimately led to\\nhim catching Covid …The sad truth is that they are never going to\\nknow where it came from.’ The family warned people to remember that the virus still existed and was ‘very real’. So was their stupidity.\\nNurses and doctors who had the ﬁrst round of the ‘vaccine’ were\\ncollapsing, dying and ending up in a hospital bed while they or their\\ngrieving relatives were saying they’d still have the ‘vaccine’ again\\ndespite what happened. I kid you not. You mean if your husband\\nreturned from the dead he’d have the same ‘vaccine’ again that killed\\nhim??\\nDoctors at the VCU Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia, said\\nthe Johnson & Johnson ‘vaccine’ was to blame for a man’s skin\\npeeling oﬀ. Patient Richard Terrell said: ‘It all just happened so fast.\\nMy skin peeled oﬀ. It’s still coming oﬀ on my hands now.’ He said it\\nwas stinging, burning and itching and when he bent his arms and\\nlegs it was very painful with ‘the skin swollen and rubbing against\\nitself’. Pﬁzer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use mRNA to change\\nthe cell while the Johnson & Johnson version uses DNA in a process\\nsimilar to AstraZeneca’s technique. Johnson & Johnson and\\nAstraZeneca have both had their ‘vaccines’ paused by many\\ncountries a\\x00er causing serious blood problems. Terrell’s doctor Fnu\\nNutan said he could have died if he hadn’t got medical a\\x00ention. It\\nsounds terrible so what did Nutan and Terrell say about the ‘vaccine’\\nnow? Oh, they still recommend that people have it. A nurse in a\\nhospital bed 40 minutes a\\x00er the vaccination and unable to swallow\\ndue to throat swelling was told by a doctor that he lost mobility in\\nhis arm for 36 hours following the vaccination. What did he say to\\nthe ailing nurse? ‘Good for you for ge\\x00ing the vaccination.’ We are\\ndealing with a serious form of cognitive dissonance madness in both\\npublic and medical staﬀ. There is a remarkable correlation between\\nthose having the ‘vaccine’ and trumpeting the fact and suﬀering bad\\nhappenings shortly a\\x00erwards. Witold Rogiewicz, a Polish doctor,\\nmade a video of his ‘vaccination’ and ridiculed those who were\\nquestioning its safety and the intentions of Bill Gates: ‘Vaccinate\\nyourself to protect yourself, your loved ones, friends and also\\npatients. And to mention quickly I have info for anti-vaxxers and\\nanti-Coviders if you want to contact Bill Gates you can do this\\nthrough me.’ He further ridiculed the dangers of 5G. Days later he was dead, but naturally the vaccination wasn’t mentioned in the\\nverdict of ‘heart a\\x00ack’.\\nLies, lies and more lies\\nSo many members of the human race have slipped into extreme\\nstates of insanity and unfortunately they include reframed doctors\\nand nursing staﬀ. Having a ‘vaccine’ and dying within minutes or\\nhours is not considered a valid connection while death from any\\ncause within 28 days or longer of a positive test with a test not\\ntesting for the ‘virus’ means ‘Covid-19’ goes on the death certiﬁcate.\\nHow could that ‘vaccine’-death connection not have been made\\nexcept by calculated deceit? US ﬁgures in the initial rollout period to\\nFebruary 12th, 2020, revealed that a third of the deaths reported to\\nthe CDC a\\x00er ‘Covid vaccines’ happened within 48 hours. Five men\\nin the UK suﬀered an ‘extremely rare’ blood clot problem a\\x00er\\nhaving the AstraZeneca ‘vaccine’, but no causal link was established\\nsaid the Gates-funded Medicines and Healthcare products\\nRegulatory Agency (MHRA) which had given the ‘vaccine’\\nemergency approval to be used. Former Pﬁzer executive Dr Michael\\nYeadon explained in his interview how the procedures could cause\\nblood coagulation and clots. People who should have been at no risk\\nwere dying from blood clots in the brain and he said he had heard\\nfrom medical doctor friends that people were suﬀering from skin\\nbleeding and massive headaches. The AstraZeneca ‘shot’ was\\nstopped by some 20 countries over the blood clo\\x00ing issue and still\\nthe corrupt MHRA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the\\nWorld Health Organization said that it should continue to be given\\neven though the EMA admi\\x00ed that it ‘still cannot rule out\\ndeﬁnitively’ a link between blood clo\\x00ing and the ‘vaccine’. Later\\nMarco Cavaleri, head of EMA vaccine strategy, said there was indeed\\na clear link between the ‘vaccine’ and thrombosis, but they didn’t\\nknow why. So much for the trials showing the ‘vaccine’ is safe. Blood\\nclots were aﬀecting younger people who would be under virtually\\nno danger from ‘Covid’ even if it existed which makes it all the more\\nstupid and sinister. The British government responded to public alarm by wheeling\\nout June Raine, the terrifyingly weak infant school headmistress\\nsound-alike who heads the UK MHRA drug ‘regulator’. The idea\\nthat she would stand up to Big Pharma and government pressure is\\nlaughable and she told us that all was well in the same way that she\\ndid when allowing untested, never-used-on-humans-before,\\ngenetically-manipulating ‘vaccines’ to be exposed to the public in the\\nﬁrst place. Mass lying is the new normal of the ‘Covid’ era. The\\nMHRA later said 30 cases of rare blood clots had by then been\\nconnected with the AstraZeneca ‘vaccine’ (that means a lot more in\\nreality) while stressing that the beneﬁts of the jab in preventing\\n‘Covid-19’ outweighed any risks. A more ridiculous and\\ndisingenuous statement with callous disregard for human health it is\\nhard to contemplate. Immediately a\\x00er the mendacious ‘all-clears’\\ntwo hospital workers in Denmark experienced blood clots and\\ncerebral haemorrhaging following the AstraZeneca jab and one died.\\nTop Norwegian health oﬃcial Pål Andre Holme said the ‘vaccine’\\nwas the only common factor: ‘There is nothing in the patient history\\nof these individuals that can give such a powerful immune response\\n… I am conﬁdent that the antibodies that we have found are the\\ncause, and I see no other explanation than it being the vaccine which\\ntriggers it.’ Strokes, a clot or bleed in the brain, were clearly\\nassociated with the ‘vaccine’ from word of mouth and whistleblower\\nreports. Similar consequences followed with all these ‘vaccines’ that\\nwe were told were so safe and as the numbers grew by the day it\\nwas clear we were witnessing human carnage.\\nLearning the hard way\\nA woman interviewed by UKColumn told how her husband\\nsuﬀered dramatic health eﬀects a\\x00er the vaccine when he’d been in\\ngood health all his life. He went from being a li\\x00le unwell to losing\\nall feeling in his legs and experiencing ‘excruciating pain’.\\nMisdiagnosis followed twice at Accident and Emergency (an\\n‘allergy’ and ‘sciatica’) before he was admi\\x00ed to a neurology ward\\nwhere doctors said his serious condition had been caused by the ‘vaccine’. Another seven ‘vaccinated’ people were apparently being\\ntreated on the same ward for similar symptoms. The woman said he\\nhad the ‘vaccine’ because they believed media claims that it was safe.\\n‘I didn’t think the government would give out a vaccine that does\\nthis to somebody; I believed they would be bringing out a\\nvaccination that would be safe.’ What a tragic way to learn that\\nlesson. Another woman posted that her husband was transporting\\nstroke patients to hospital on almost every shi\\x00 and when he asked\\nthem if they had been ‘vaccinated’ for ‘Covid’ they all replied ‘yes’.\\nOne had a ‘massive brain bleed’ the day a\\x00er his second dose. She\\nsaid her husband reported the ‘just been vaccinated’ information\\nevery time to doctors in A and E only for them to ignore it, make no\\nnotes and appear annoyed that it was even mentioned. This\\nparticular report cannot be veriﬁed, but it expresses a common\\ntheme that conﬁrms the monumental underreporting of ‘vaccine’\\nconsequences. Interestingly as the ‘vaccines’ and their brain blood\\nclot/stroke consequences began to emerge the UK National Health\\nService began a publicity campaign telling the public what to do in\\nthe event of a stroke. A Sco\\x00ish NHS staﬀ nurse who quit in disgust\\nin March, 2021, said:\\nI have seen traumatic injuries from the vaccine, they’re not getting reported to the yellow card\\n[adverse reaction] scheme, they’re treating the symptoms, not asking why, why it’s happening.\\nIt’s just treating the symptoms and when you speak about it you’re dismissed like you’re crazy,\\nI’m not crazy, I’m not crazy because every other colleague I’ve spoken to is terrified to speak\\nout, they’ve had enough.\\nVideos appeared on the Internet of people uncontrollably shaking\\na\\x00er the ‘vaccine’ with no control over muscles, limbs and even their\\nface. A Sco\\x00ish mother broke out in a severe rash all over her body\\nalmost immediately a\\x00er she was given the AstraZeneca ‘vaccine’.\\nThe pictures were horriﬁc. Leigh King, a 41-year-old hairdresser\\nfrom Lanarkshire said: ‘Never in my life was I prepared for what I\\nwas about to experience … My skin was so sore and constantly hot\\n… I have never felt pain like this …’ But don’t you worry, the\\n‘vaccine’ is perfectly safe. Then there has been the eﬀect on medical staﬀ who have been pressured to have the ‘vaccine’ by psychopathic\\n‘health’ authorities and government. A London hospital consultant\\nwho gave the name K. Polyakova wrote this to the British Medical\\nJournal or BMJ:\\nI am currently struggling with … the failure to report the reality of the morbidity caused by our\\ncurrent vaccination program within the health service and staff population. The levels of\\nsickness after vaccination is unprecedented and staff are getting very sick and some with\\nneurological symptoms which is having a huge impact on the health service function. Even\\nthe young and healthy are off for days, some for weeks, and some requiring medical\\ntreatment. Whole teams are being taken out as they went to get vaccinated together.\\nMandatory vaccination in this instance is stupid, unethical and irresponsible when it comes to\\nprotecting our staff and public health. We are in the voluntary phase of vaccination, and\\nencouraging staff to take an unlicensed product that is impacting on their immediate health …\\nit is clearly stated that these vaccine products do not offer immunity or stop transmission. In\\nwhich case why are we doing it?\\nNot to protect health that’s for sure. Medical workers are lauded by\\ngovernments for agenda reasons when they couldn’t give a toss\\nabout them any more than they can for the population in general.\\nSchools across America faced the same situation as they closed due\\nto the high number of teachers and other staﬀ with bad reactions to\\nthe Pﬁzer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson ‘Covid\\nvaccines’ all of which were linked to death and serious adverse\\neﬀects. The BMJ took down the consultant’s comments pre\\x00y\\nquickly on the grounds that they were being used to spread\\n‘disinformation’. They were exposing the truth about the ‘vaccine’\\nwas the real reason. The cover-up is breathtaking.\\nHiding the evidence\\nThe scale of the ‘vaccine’ death cover-up worldwide can be\\nconﬁrmed by comparing oﬃcial ﬁgures with the personal experience\\nof the public. I heard of many people in my community who died\\nimmediately or soon a\\x00er the vaccine that would never appear in the\\nmedia or even likely on the oﬃcial totals of ‘vaccine’ fatalities and\\nadverse reactions when only about ten percent are estimated to be reported and I have seen some estimates as low as one percent in a\\nHarvard study. In the UK alone by April 29th, 2021, some 757,654\\nadverse reactions had been oﬃcially reported from the\\nPﬁzer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna ‘vaccines’ with\\nmore than a thousand deaths linked to jabs and that means an\\nestimated ten times this number in reality from a ten percent\\nreporting rate percentage. That’s seven million adverse reactions and\\n10,000 potential deaths and a one percent reporting rate would be\\nten times those ﬁgures. In 1976 the US government pulled the swine\\nﬂu vaccine a\\x00er 53 deaths. The UK data included a combined 10,000\\neye disorders from the ‘Covid vaccines’ with more than 750 suﬀering\\nvisual impairment or blindness and again multiply by the estimated\\nreporting percentages. As ‘Covid cases’ oﬃcially fell hospitals\\nvirtually empty during the ‘Covid crisis’ began to ﬁll up with a\\nrange of other problems in the wake of the ‘vaccine’ rollout. The\\nnumbers across America have also been catastrophic. Deaths linked\\nto all types of vaccine increased by 6,000 percent in the ﬁrst quarter of\\n2021 compared with 2020. A 39-year-old woman from Ogden, Utah,\\ndied four days a\\x00er receiving a second dose of Moderna’s ‘Covid\\nvaccine’ when her liver, heart and kidneys all failed despite the fact\\nthat she had no known medical issues or conditions. Her family\\nsought an autopsy, but Dr Erik Christensen, Utah’s chief medical\\nexaminer, said proving vaccine injury as a cause of death almost\\nnever happened. He could think of only one instance where an\\nautopsy would name a vaccine as the oﬃcial cause of death and that\\nwould be anaphylaxis where someone received a vaccine and died\\nalmost instantaneously. ‘Short of that, it would be diﬃcult for us to\\ndeﬁnitively say this is the vaccine,’ Christensen said. If that is true\\nthis must be added to the estimated ten percent (or far less)\\nreporting rate of vaccine deaths and serious reactions and the\\nconclusion can only be that vaccine deaths and serious reactions –\\nincluding these ‘Covid’ potions’ – are phenomenally understated in\\noﬃcial ﬁgures. The same story can be found everywhere. Endless\\naccounts of deaths and serious reactions among the public, medical and care home staﬀ while oﬃcial ﬁgures did not even begin to\\nreﬂect this.\\nProfessional script-reader Dr David Williams, a ‘top public-health\\noﬃcial’ in Ontario, Canada, insulted our intelligence by claiming\\nonly four serious adverse reactions and no deaths from the more\\nthan 380,000 vaccine doses then given. This bore no resemblance to\\nwhat people knew had happened in their owns circles and we had\\nDirk Huyer in charge of ge\\x00ing millions vaccinated in Ontario while\\nat the same time he was Chief Coroner for the province investigating\\ncauses of death including possible death from the vaccine. An aide\\nsaid he had stepped back from investigating deaths, but evidence\\nindicated otherwise. Rosemary Frei, who secured a Master of Science\\ndegree in molecular biology at the Faculty of Medicine at Canada’s\\nUniversity of Calgary before turning to investigative journalism, was\\none who could see that oﬃcial ﬁgures for ‘vaccine’ deaths and\\nreactions made no sense. She said that doctors seldom reported\\nadverse events and when people got really sick or died a\\x00er ge\\x00ing\\na vaccination they would a\\x00ribute that to anything except the\\nvaccines. It had been that way for years and anyone who wondered\\naloud whether the ‘Covid vaccines’ or other shots cause harm is\\nimmediately branded as ‘anti-vax’ and ‘anti-science’. This was\\n‘career-threatening’ for health professionals. Then there was the\\nhuge pressure to support the push to ‘vaccinate’ billions in the\\nquickest time possible. Frei said:\\nSo that’s where we’re at today. More than half a million vaccine doses have been given to\\npeople in Ontario alone. The rush is on to vaccinate all 15 million of us in the province by\\nSeptember. And the mainstream media are screaming for this to be sped up even more. That\\nall adds up to only a very slim likelihood that we’re going to be told the truth by officials\\nabout how many people are getting sick or dying from the vaccines.\\nWhat is true of Ontario is true of everywhere.\\nThey KNEW – and still did it\\nThe authorities knew what was going to happen with multiple\\ndeaths and adverse reactions. The UK government’s Gates-funded and Big Pharma-dominated Medicines and Healthcare products\\nRegulatory Agency (MHRA) hired a company to employ AI in\\ncompiling the projected reactions to the ‘vaccine’ that would\\notherwise be uncountable. The request for applications said: ‘The\\nMHRA urgently seeks an Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) so\\x00ware tool to\\nprocess the expected high volume of Covid-19 vaccine Adverse Drug\\nReaction …’ This was from the agency, headed by the disingenuous\\nJune Raine, that gave the ‘vaccines’ emergency approval and the\\ncompany was hired before the ﬁrst shot was given. ‘We are going to\\nkill and maim you – is that okay?’ ‘Oh, yes, perfectly ﬁne – I’m very\\ngrateful, thank you, doctor.’ The range of ‘Covid vaccine’ adverse\\nreactions goes on for page a\\x00er page in the MHRA criminally\\nunderreported ‘Yellow Card’ system and includes aﬀects to eyes,\\nears, skin, digestion, blood and so on. Raine’s MHRA amazingly\\nclaimed that the ‘overall safety experience … is so far as expected\\nfrom the clinical trials’. The death, serious adverse eﬀects, deafness\\nand blindness were expected? When did they ever mention that? If\\nthese human tragedies were expected then those that gave approval\\nfor the use of these ‘vaccines’ must be guilty of crimes against\\nhumanity including murder – a deﬁnition of which is ‘killing a\\nperson with malice aforethought or with recklessness manifesting\\nextreme indiﬀerence to the value of human life.’ People involved at\\nthe MHRA, the CDC in America and their equivalent around the\\nworld must go before Nuremberg trials to answer for their callous\\ninhumanity. We are only talking here about the immediate eﬀects of\\nthe ‘vaccine’. The longer-term impact of the DNA synthetic\\nmanipulation is the main reason they are so hysterically desperate to\\ninoculate the entire global population in the shortest possible time.\\nAfrica and the developing world are a major focus for the ‘vaccine’\\ndepopulation agenda and a mass vaccination sales-pitch is\\nunderway thanks to caring people like the Rockefellers and other\\nCult assets. The Rockefeller Foundation, which pre-empted the\\n‘Covid pandemic’ in a document published in 2010 that ‘predicted’\\nwhat happened a decade later, announced an initial $34.95 million\\ngrant in February, 2021, ‘to ensure more equitable access to Covid-19 testing and vaccines’ among other things in Africa in collaboration\\nwith ‘24 organizations, businesses, and government agencies’. The\\npan-Africa initiative would focus on 10 countries: Burkina Faso,\\nEthiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania,\\nUganda, and Zambia’. Rajiv Shah, President of the Rockefeller\\nFoundation and former administrator of CIA-controlled USAID, said\\nthat if Africa was not mass-vaccinated (to change the DNA of its\\npeople) it was a ‘threat to all of humanity’ and not fair on Africans.\\nWhen someone from the Rockefeller Foundation says they want to\\ndo something to help poor and deprived people and countries it is\\ntime for a belly-laugh. They are doing this out of the goodness of\\ntheir ‘heart’ because ‘vaccinating’ the entire global population is\\nwhat the ‘Covid’ hoax set out to achieve. Oﬃcial ‘decolonisation’ of\\nAfrica by the Cult was merely a prelude to ﬁnancial colonisation on\\nthe road to a return to physical colonisation. The ‘vaccine’ is vital to\\nthat and the sudden and convenient death of the ‘Covid’ sceptic\\npresident of Tanzania can be seen in its true light. A lot of people in\\nAfrica are aware that this is another form of colonisation and\\nexploitation and they need to stand their ground.\\nThe ‘vaccine is working’ scam\\nA potential problem for the Cult was that the ‘vaccine’ is meant to\\nchange human DNA and body messaging and not to protect anyone\\nfrom a ‘virus’ never shown to exist. The vaccine couldn’t work\\nbecause it was not designed to work and how could they make it\\nappear to be working so that more people would have it? This was\\novercome by lowering the ampliﬁcation rate of the PCR test to\\nproduce fewer ‘cases’ and therefore fewer ‘deaths’. Some of us had\\nbeen pointing out since March, 2020, that the ampliﬁcation rate of\\nthe test not testing for the ‘virus’ had been made artiﬁcially high to\\ngenerate positive tests which they could call ‘cases’ to justify\\nlockdowns. The World Health Organization recommended an\\nabsurdly high 45 ampliﬁcation cycles to ensure the high positives\\nrequired by the Cult and then remained silent on the issue until\\nJanuary 20th, 2021 – Biden’s Inauguration Day. This was when the ‘vaccinations’ were seriously underway and on that day the WHO\\nrecommended a\\x00er discussions with America’s CDC that\\nlaboratories lowered their testing amplification. Dr David Samadi, a\\ncertiﬁed urologist and health writer, said the WHO was encouraging\\nall labs to reduce their cycle count for PCR tests. He said the current\\ncycle was much too high and was ‘resulting in any particle being\\ndeclared a positive case’. Even one mainstream news report I saw\\nsaid this meant the number of ‘Covid’ infections may have been\\n‘dramatically inﬂated’. Oh, just a li\\x00le bit. The CDC in America\\nissued new guidance to laboratories in April, 2021, to use 28 cycles\\nbut only for ‘vaccinated’ people. The timing of the CDC/WHO\\ninterventions were cynically designed to make it appear the\\n‘vaccines’ were responsible for falling cases and deaths when the real\\nreason can be seen in the following examples. New York’s state lab,\\nthe Wadsworth Center, identiﬁed 872 positive tests in July, 2020,\\nbased on a threshold of 40 cycles. When the ﬁgure was lowered to 35\\ncycles 43 percent of the 872 were no longer ‘positives’. At 30 cycles\\nthe ﬁgure was 63 percent. A Massachuse\\x00s lab found that between\\n85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle\\nthreshold of 40 would be negative at 30 cycles, Ashish Jha, MD,\\ndirector of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said: ‘I’m really\\nshocked that it could be that high … Boy, does it really change the\\nway we need to be thinking about testing.’ I’m shocked that I could\\nsee the obvious in the spring of 2020, with no medical background,\\nand most medical professionals still haven’t worked it out. No, that’s\\nnot shocking – it’s terrifying.\\nThree weeks a\\x00er the WHO directive to lower PCR cycles the\\nLondon Daily Mail ran this headline: ‘Why ARE Covid cases\\nplummeting? New infections have fallen 45% in the US and 30%\\nglobally in the past 3 weeks but experts say vaccine is NOT the main\\ndriver because only 8% of Americans and 13% of people worldwide\\nhave received their ﬁrst dose.’ They acknowledged that the drop\\ncould not be a\\x00ributed to the ‘vaccine’, but soon this morphed\\nthroughout the media into the ‘vaccine’ has caused cases and deaths\\nto fall when it was the PCR threshold. In December, 2020, there was chaos at English Channel ports with truck drivers needing negative\\n‘Covid’ tests before they could board a ferry home for Christmas.\\nThe government wanted to remove the backlog as fast as possible\\nand they brought in troops to do the ‘testing’. Out of 1,600 drivers\\njust 36 tested positive and the rest were given the all clear to cross\\nthe Channel. I guess the authorities thought that 36 was the least\\nthey could get away with without the unquestioning catching on.\\nThe ampliﬁcation trick which most people believed in the absence of\\ninformation in the mainstream applied more pressure on those\\nrefusing the ‘vaccine’ to succumb when it ‘obviously worked’. The\\ntruth was the exact opposite with deaths in care homes soaring with\\nthe ‘vaccine’ and in Israel the term used was ‘skyrocket’. A re-\\nanalysis of published data from the Israeli Health Ministry led by Dr\\nHervé Seligmann at the Medicine Emerging Infectious and Tropical\\nDiseases at Aix-Marseille University found that Pﬁzer’s ‘Covid\\nvaccine’ killed ‘about 40 times more [elderly] people than the disease\\nitself would have killed’ during a ﬁve-week vaccination period and\\n260 times more younger people than would have died from the\\n‘virus’ even according to the manipulated ‘virus’ ﬁgures. Dr\\nSeligmann and his co-study author, Haim Yativ, declared a\\x00er\\nreviewing the Israeli ‘vaccine’ death data: ‘This is a new Holocaust.’\\nThen, in mid-April, 2021, a\\x00er vast numbers of people worldwide\\nhad been ‘vaccinated’, the story changed with clear coordination.\\nThe UK government began to prepare the ground for more future\\nlockdowns when Nuremberg-destined Boris Johnson told yet\\nanother whopper. He said that cases had fallen because of lockdowns\\nnot ‘vaccines’. Lockdowns are irrelevant when there is no ‘virus’ and\\nthe test and fraudulent death certiﬁcates are deciding the number of\\n‘cases’ and ‘deaths’. Study a\\x00er study has shown that lockdowns\\ndon’t work and instead kill and psychologically destroy people.\\nMeanwhile in the United States Anthony Fauci and Rochelle\\nWalensky, the ultra-Zionist head of the CDC, peddled the same line.\\nMore lockdown was the answer and not the ‘vaccine’, a line repeated\\non cue by the moron that is Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\\nWhy all the hysteria to get everyone ‘vaccinated’ if lockdowns and not ‘vaccines’ made the diﬀerence? None of it makes sense on the\\nface of it. Oh, but it does. The Cult wants lockdowns and the\\n‘vaccine’ and if the ‘vaccine’ is allowed to be seen as the total answer\\nlockdowns would no longer be justiﬁed when there are still\\nlivelihoods to destroy. ‘Variants’ and renewed upward manipulation\\nof PCR ampliﬁcation are planned to instigate never-ending\\nlockdown and more ‘vaccines’.\\nYou must have it – we’re desperate\\nIsrael, where the Jewish and Arab population are ruled by the\\nSabbatian Cult, was the front-runner in imposing the DNA-\\nmanipulating ‘vaccine’ on its people to such an extent that Jewish\\nrefusers began to liken what was happening to the early years of\\nNazi Germany. This would seem to be a fantastic claim. Why would\\na government of Jewish people be acting like the Nazis did? If you\\nrealise that the Sabbatian Cult was behind the Nazis and that\\nSabbatians hate Jews the pieces start to ﬁt and the question of why a\\n‘Jewish’ government would treat Jews with such callous disregard\\nfor their lives and freedom ﬁnds an answer. Those controlling the\\ngovernment of Israel aren’t Jewish – they’re Sabbatian. Israeli lawyer\\nTamir Turgal was one who made the Nazi comparison in comments\\nto German lawyer Reiner Fuellmich who is leading a class action\\nlawsuit against the psychopaths for crimes against humanity. Turgal\\ndescribed how the Israeli government was vaccinating children and\\npregnant women on the basis that there was no evidence that this\\nwas dangerous when they had no evidence that it wasn’t dangerous\\neither. They just had no evidence. This was medical experimentation\\nand Turgal said this breached the Nuremberg Code about medical\\nexperimentation and procedures requiring informed consent and\\nchoice. Think about that. A Nuremberg Code developed because of\\nNazi experimentation on Jews and others in concentration camps by\\npeople like the evil-beyond-belief Josef Mengele is being breached by\\nthe Israeli government; but when you know that it’s a Sabbatian\\ngovernment along with its intelligence and military agencies like\\nMossad, Shin Bet and the Israeli Defense Forces, and that Sabbatians were the force behind the Nazis, the kaleidoscope comes into focus.\\nWhat have we come to when Israeli Jews are suing their government\\nfor violating the Nuremberg Code by essentially making Israelis\\nsubject to a medical experiment using the controversial ‘vaccines’?\\nIt’s a shocker that this has to be done in the light of what happened\\nin Nazi Germany. The Anshe Ha-Emet, or ‘People of the Truth’,\\nmade up of Israeli doctors, lawyers, campaigners and public, have\\nlaunched a lawsuit with the International Criminal Court. It says:\\nWhen the heads of the Ministry of Health as well as the prime minister presented the vaccine\\nin Israel and began the vaccination of Israeli residents, the vaccinated were not advised, that,\\nin practice, they are taking part in a medical experiment and that their consent is required for\\nthis under the Nuremberg Code.\\nThe irony is unbelievable, but easily explained in one word:\\nSabbatians. The foundation of Israeli ‘Covid’ apartheid is the ‘green\\npass’ or ‘green passport’ which allows Jews and Arabs who have\\nhad the DNA-manipulating ‘vaccine’ to go about their lives – to\\nwork, ﬂy, travel in general, go to shopping malls, bars, restaurants,\\nhotels, concerts, gyms, swimming pools, theatres and sports venues,\\nwhile non-’vaccinated’ are banned from all those places and\\nactivities. Israelis have likened the ‘green pass’ to the yellow stars\\nthat Jews in Nazi Germany were forced to wear – the same as the\\nyellow stickers that a branch of UK supermarket chain Morrisons\\ntold exempt mask-wears they had to display when shopping. How\\nvery sensitive. The Israeli system is blatant South African-style\\napartheid on the basis of compliance or non-compliance to fascism\\nrather than colour of the skin. How appropriate that the Sabbatian\\nIsraeli government was so close to the pre-Mandela apartheid\\nregime in Pretoria. The Sabbatian-instigated ‘vaccine passport’ in\\nIsrael is planned for everywhere. Sabbatians struck a deal with\\nPﬁzer that allowed them to lead the way in the percentage of a\\nnational population infused with synthetic material and the result\\nwas catastrophic. Israeli freedom activist Shai Dannon told me how\\nchairs were appearing on beaches that said ‘vaccinated only’. Health\\nMinister Yuli Edelstein said that anyone unwilling or unable to get the jabs that ‘confer immunity’ will be ‘le\\x00 behind’. The man’s a liar.\\nNot even the makers claim the ‘vaccines’ confer immunity. When\\nyou see those ﬁgures of ‘vaccine’ deaths these psychopaths were\\nsaying that you must take the chance the ‘vaccine’ will kill you or\\nmaim you while knowing it will change your DNA or lockdown for\\nyou will be permanent. That’s fascism. The Israeli parliament passed\\na law to allow personal information of the non-vaccinated to be\\nshared with local and national authorities for three months. This was\\nclaimed by its supporters to be a way to ‘encourage’ people to be\\nvaccinated. Hadas Ziv from Physicians for Human Rights described\\nthis as a ‘draconian law which crushed medical ethics and the\\npatient rights’. But that’s the idea, the Sabbatians would reply.\\nYour papers, please\\nSabbatian Israel was leading what has been planned all along to be a\\nglobal ‘vaccine pass’ called a ‘green passport’ without which you\\nwould remain in permanent lockdown restriction and unable to do\\nanything. This is how badly – desperately – the Cult is to get everyone\\n‘vaccinated’. The term and colour ‘green’ was not by chance and\\nrelated to the psychology of fusing the perception of the green\\nclimate hoax with the ‘Covid’ hoax and how the ‘solution’ to both is\\nthe same Great Reset. Lying politicians, health oﬃcials and\\npsychologists denied there were any plans for mandatory\\nvaccinations or restrictions based on vaccinations, but they knew\\nthat was exactly what was meant to happen with governments of all\\ncountries reaching agreements to enforce a global system. ‘Free’\\nDenmark and ‘free’ Sweden unveiled digital vaccine certiﬁcation.\\nCyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy,\\nPoland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain have all commi\\x00ed to a\\nvaccine passport system and the rest including the whole of the EU\\nwould follow. The satanic UK government will certainly go this way\\ndespite mendacious denials and at the time of writing it is trying to\\nmanipulate the public into having the ‘vaccine’ so they could go\\nabroad on a summer holiday. How would that work without\\nsomething to prove you had the synthetic toxicity injected into you? Documents show that the EU’s European Commission was moving\\ntowards ‘vaccine certiﬁcates’ in 2018 and 2019 before the ‘Covid’\\nhoax began. They knew what was coming. Abracadabra – Ursula\\nvon der Leyen, the German President of the Commission,\\nannounced in March, 2021, an EU ‘Digital Green Certiﬁcate’ – green\\nagain – to track the public’s ‘Covid status’. The passport sting is\\nworldwide and the Far East followed the same pa\\x00ern with South\\nKorea ruling that only those with ‘vaccination’ passports – again the\\ngreen pass – would be able to ‘return to their daily lives’.\\nBill Gates has been preparing for this ‘passport’ with other Cult\\noperatives for years and beyond the paper version is a Gates-funded\\n‘digital ta\\x00oo’ to identify who has been vaccinated and who hasn’t.\\nThe ‘ta\\x00oo’ is reported to include a substance which is externally\\nreadable to conﬁrm who has been vaccinated. This is a bio-luminous\\nlight-generating enzyme (think ﬁreﬂies) called … Luciferase. Yes,\\nnamed a\\x00er the Cult ‘god’ Lucifer the ‘light bringer’ of whom more\\nto come. Gates said he funded the readable ta\\x00oo to ensure children\\nin the developing world were vaccinated and no one was missed out.\\nHe cares so much about poor kids as we know. This was just the\\ncover story to develop a vaccine tagging system for everyone on the\\nplanet. Gates has been funding the ID2020 ‘alliance’ to do just that in\\nleague with other lovely people at Microso\\x00, GAVI, the Rockefeller\\nFoundation, Accenture and IDEO.org. He said in interviews in\\nMarch, 2020, before any ‘vaccine’ publicly existed, that the world\\nmust have a globalised digital certiﬁcate to track the ‘virus’ and who\\nhad been vaccinated. Gates knew from the start that the mRNA\\nvaccines were coming and when they would come and that the plan\\nwas to tag the ‘vaccinated’ to marginalise the intelligent and stop\\nthem doing anything including travel. Evil just doesn’t suﬃce. Gates\\nwas exposed for oﬀering a $10 million bribe to the Nigerian House\\nof Representatives to invoke compulsory ‘Covid’ vaccination of all\\nNigerians. Sara Cunial, a member of the Italian Parliament, called\\nGates a ‘vaccine criminal’. She urged the Italian President to hand\\nhim over to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity and condemned his plans to ‘chip the human race’\\nthrough ID2020.\\nYou know it’s a long-planned agenda when war criminal and Cult\\ngofer Tony Blair is on the case. With the scale of arrogance only\\nsomeone as dark as Blair can muster he said: ‘Vaccination in the end\\nis going to be your route to liberty.’ Blair is a disgusting piece of\\nwork and he conﬁrms that again. The media has given a lot of\\ncoverage to a bloke called Charlie Mullins, founder of London’s\\nbiggest independent plumbing company, Pimlico Plumbers, who has\\nsaid he won’t employ anyone who has not been vaccinated or have\\nthem go to any home where people are not vaccinated. He said that\\nif he had his way no one would be allowed to walk the streets if they\\nhave not been vaccinated. Gates was cheering at the time while I was\\nalerting the white coats. The plan is that people will qualify for\\n‘passports’ for having the ﬁrst two doses and then to keep it they\\nwill have to have all the follow ups and new ones for invented\\n‘variants’ until human genetics is transformed and many are dead\\nwho can’t adjust to the changes. Hollywood celebrities – the usual\\npropaganda stunt – are promoting something called the WELL\\nHealth-Safety Rating to verify that a building or space has ‘taken the\\nnecessary steps to prioritize the health and safety of their staﬀ,\\nvisitors and other stakeholders’. They included Lady Gaga, Jennifer\\nLopez, Michael B. Jordan, Robert DeNiro, Venus Williams, Wolfgang\\nPuck, Deepak Chopra and 17th Surgeon General Richard Carmona.\\nYawn. WELL Health-Safety has big connections with China. Parent\\ncompany Delos is headed by former Goldman Sachs partner Paul\\nScialla. This is another example – and we will see so many others –\\nof using the excuse of ‘health’ to dictate the lives and activities of the\\npopulation. I guess one conﬁrmation of the ‘safety’ of buildings is\\nthat only ‘vaccinated’ people can go in, right?\\nElectronic concentration camps\\nI wrote decades ago about the plans to restrict travel and here we are\\nfor those who refuse to bow to tyranny. This can be achieved in one\\ngo with air travel if the aviation industry makes a blanket decree. The ‘vaccine’ and guaranteed income are designed to be part of a\\nglobal version of China’s social credit system which tracks behaviour\\n24/7 and awards or deletes ‘credits’ based on whether your\\nbehaviour is supported by the state or not. I mean your entire\\nlifestyle – what you do, eat, say, everything. Once your credit score\\nfalls below a certain level consequences kick in. In China tens of\\nmillions have been denied travel by air and train because of this. All\\nthe locations and activities denied to refusers by the ‘vaccine’\\npassports will be included in one big mass ban on doing almost\\nanything for those that don’t bow their head to government. It’s\\nbeyond fascist and a new term is required to describe its extremes – I\\nguess fascist technocracy will have to do. The way the Chinese\\nsystem of technological – technocratic – control is sweeping the West\\ncan be seen in the Los Angeles school system and is planned to be\\nexpanded worldwide. Every child is required to have a ‘Covid’-\\ntracking app scanned daily before they can enter the classroom. The\\nso-called Daily Pass tracking system is produced by Gates’ Microso\\x00\\nwhich I’m sure will shock you rigid. The pass will be scanned using\\na barcode (one step from an inside-the-body barcode) and the\\ninformation will include health checks, ‘Covid’ tests and\\nvaccinations. Entry codes are for one speciﬁc building only and\\naccess will only be allowed if a student or teacher has a negative test\\nwith a test not testing for the ‘virus’, has no symptoms of anything\\nalleged to be related to ‘Covid’ (symptoms from a range of other\\nillness), and has a temperature under 100 degrees. No barcode, no\\nentry, is planned to be the case for everywhere and not only schools.\\nKids are being psychologically prepared to accept this as ‘normal’\\ntheir whole life which is why what they can impose in schools is so\\nimportant to the Cult and its gofers. Long-time American freedom\\ncampaigner John Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute was not\\nexaggerating when he said: ‘Databit by databit, we are building our\\nown electronic concentration camps.’ Canada under its Cult gofer\\nprime minister Justin Trudeau has taken a major step towards the\\nreal thing with people interned against their will if they test positive\\nwith a test not testing for the ‘virus’ when they arrive at a Canadian airport. They are jailed in internment hotels o\\x00en without food or\\nwater for long periods and with many doors failing to lock there\\nhave been sexual assaults. The interned are being charged\\nsometimes $2,000 for the privilege of being abused in this way.\\nTrudeau is fully on board with the Cult and says the ‘Covid\\npandemic’ has provided an opportunity for a global ‘reset’ to\\npermanently change Western civilisation. His number two, Deputy\\nPrime Minister Chrystia Freeland, is a trustee of the World Economic\\nForum and a Rhodes Scholar. The Trudeau family have long been\\nservants of the Cult. See The Biggest Secret and Cathy O’Brien’s book\\nTrance-Formation of America for the horriﬁc background to Trudeau’s\\nfather Pierre Trudeau another Canadian prime minister. Hide your\\nfascism behind the façade of a heart-on-the-sleeve liberal. It’s a well-\\nhoned Cult technique.\\nWhat can the ‘vaccine’ really do?\\nWe have a ‘virus’ never shown to exist and ‘variants’ of the ‘virus’\\nthat have also never been shown to exist except, like the ‘original’, as\\ncomputer-generated ﬁctions. Even if you believe there’s a ‘virus’ the\\n‘case’ to ‘death’ rate is in the region of 0.23 to 0.15 percent and those\\n‘deaths’ are concentrated among the very old around the same\\naverage age that people die anyway. In response to this lack of threat\\n(in truth none) psychopaths and idiots, knowingly and unknowingly\\nanswering to Gates and the Cult, are seeking to ‘vaccinate’ every\\nman, woman and child on Planet Earth. Clearly the ‘vaccine’ is not\\nabout ‘Covid’ – none of this ever has been. So what is it all about\\nreally? Why the desperation to infuse genetically-manipulating\\nsynthetic material into everyone through mRNA fraudulent\\n‘vaccines’ with the intent of doing this over and over with the\\nexcuses of ‘variants’ and other ‘virus’ inventions? Dr Sherri\\nTenpenny, an osteopathic medical doctor in the United States, has\\nmade herself an expert on vaccines and their eﬀects as a vehement\\ncampaigner against their use. Tenpenny was board certiﬁed in\\nemergency medicine, the director of a level two trauma centre for 12\\nyears, and moved to Cleveland in 1996 to start an integrative medicine practice which has treated patients from all 50 states and\\nsome 17 other countries. Weaning people oﬀ pharmaceutical drugs is\\na speciality.\\nShe became interested in the consequences of vaccines a\\x00er\\na\\x00ending a meeting at the National Vaccine Information Center in\\nWashington DC in 2000 where she ‘sat through four days of listening\\nto medical doctors and scientists and lawyers and parents of vaccine\\ninjured kids’ and asked: ‘What’s going on?’ She had never been\\nvaccinated and never got ill while her father was given a list of\\nvaccines to be in the military and was ‘sick his entire life’. The\\nexperience added to her questions and she began to examine vaccine\\ndocuments from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). A\\x00er\\nreading the ﬁrst one, the 1998 version of The General Recommendations\\nof Vaccination, she thought: ‘This is it?’ The document was poorly\\nwri\\x00en and bad science and Tenpenny began 20 years of research\\ninto vaccines that continues to this day. She began her research into\\n‘Covid vaccines’ in March, 2020, and she describes them as ‘deadly’.\\nFor many, as we have seen, they already have been. Tenpenny said\\nthat in the ﬁrst 30 days of the ‘vaccine’ rollout in the United States\\nthere had been more than 40,000 adverse events reported to the\\nvaccine adverse event database. A document had been delivered to\\nher the day before that was 172 pages long. ‘We have over 40,000\\nadverse events; we have over 3,100 cases of [potentially deadly]\\nanaphylactic shock; we have over 5,000 neurological reactions.’\\nEﬀects ranged from headaches to numbness, dizziness and vertigo,\\nto losing feeling in hands or feet and paraesthesia which is when\\nlimbs ‘fall asleep’ and people have the sensation of insects crawling\\nunderneath their skin. All this happened in the ﬁrst 30 days and\\nremember that only about ten percent (or far less) of adverse reactions\\nand vaccine-related deaths are estimated to be oﬃcially reported.\\nTenpenny said:\\nSo can you think of one single product in any industry, any industry, for as long as products\\nhave been made on the planet that within 30 days we have 40,000 people complaining of\\nside effects that not only is still on the market but … we’ve got paid actors telling us how great they are for getting their vaccine. We’re offering people $500 if they will just get their vaccine\\nand we’ve got nurses and doctors going; ‘I got the vaccine, I got the vaccine’.\\nTenpenny said they were not going to be ‘happy dancing folks’\\nwhen they began to suﬀer Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis),\\nneuropathies, cardiac arrhythmias and autoimmune reactions that\\nkill through a blood disorder. ‘They’re not going to be so happy,\\nhappy then, but we’re never going to see pictures of those people’\\nshe said. Tenpenny described the ‘vaccine’ as ‘a well-designed killing\\ntool’.\\nNo off-switch\\nBad as the initial consequences had been Tenpenny said it would be\\nmaybe 14 months before we began to see the ‘full ravage’ of what is\\ngoing to happen to the ‘Covid vaccinated’ with full-out\\nconsequences taking anything between two years and 20 years to\\nshow. You can understand why when you consider that variations of\\nthe ‘Covid vaccine’ use mRNA (messenger RNA) to in theory\\nactivate the immune system to produce protective antibodies\\nwithout using the actual ‘virus’. How can they when it’s a computer\\nprogram and they’ve never isolated what they claim is the ‘real\\nthing’? Instead they use synthetic mRNA. They are inoculating\\nsynthetic material into the body which through a technique known\\nas the Trojan horse is absorbed into cells to change the nature of\\nDNA. Human DNA is changed by an infusion of messenger RNA\\nand with each new ‘vaccine’ of this type it is changed even more. Say\\nso and you are banned by Cult Internet platforms. The contempt the\\ncontemptuous Mark Zuckerberg has for the truth and human health\\ncan be seen in an internal Facebook video leaked to the Project\\nVeritas investigative team in which he said of the ‘Covid vaccines’:\\n‘… I share some caution on this because we just don’t know the long\\nterm side-eﬀects of basically modifying people’s DNA and RNA.’ At\\nthe same time this disgusting man’s Facebook was censoring and\\nbanning anyone saying exactly the same. He must go before a\\nNuremberg trial for crimes against humanity when he knows that he is censoring legitimate concerns and denying the right of informed\\nconsent on behalf of the Cult that owns him. People have been killed\\nand damaged by the very ‘vaccination’ technique he cast doubt on\\nhimself when they may not have had the ‘vaccine’ with access to\\ninformation that he denied them. The plan is to have at least annual\\n‘Covid vaccinations’, add others to deal with invented ‘variants’, and\\nchange all other vaccines into the mRNA system. Pﬁzer executives\\ntold shareholders at a virtual Barclays Global Healthcare Conference\\nin March, 2021, that the public may need a third dose of ‘Covid\\nvaccine’, plus regular yearly boosters and the company planned to\\nhike prices to milk the proﬁts in a ‘signiﬁcant opportunity for our\\nvaccine’. These are the professional liars, cheats and opportunists\\nwho are telling you their ‘vaccine’ is safe. Given this volume of\\nmRNA planned to be infused into the human body and its ability to\\nthen replicate we will have a transformation of human genetics from\\nbiological to synthetic biological – exactly the long-time Cult plan for\\nreasons we’ll see – and many will die. Sherri Tenpenny said of this\\nreplication:\\nIt’s like having an on-button but no off-button and that whole mechanism … they actually\\ngive it a name and they call it the Trojan horse mechanism, because it allows that [synthetic]\\nvirus and that piece of that [synthetic] virus to get inside of your cells, start to replicate and\\neven get inserted into other parts of your DNA as a Trojan-horse.\\nAsk the overwhelming majority of people who have the ‘vaccine’\\nwhat they know about the contents and what they do and they\\nwould reply: ‘The government says it will stop me ge\\x00ing the virus.’\\nGovernments give that false impression on purpose to increase take-\\nup. You can read Sherri Tenpenny’s detailed analysis of the health\\nconsequences in her blog at Vaxxter.com, but in summary these are\\nsome of them. She highlights the statement by Bill Gates about how\\nhuman beings can become their own ‘vaccine manufacturing\\nmachine’. The man is insane. [‘Vaccine’-generated] ‘antibodies’ carry\\nsynthetic messenger RNA into the cells and the damage starts,\\nTenpenny contends, and she says that lungs can be adversely\\naﬀected through varying degrees of pus and bleeding which obviously aﬀects breathing and would be dubbed ‘Covid-19’. Even\\nmore sinister was the impact of ‘antibodies’ on macrophages, a white\\nblood cell of the immune system. They consist of Type 1 and Type 2\\nwhich have very diﬀerent functions. She said Type 1 are ‘hyper-\\nvigilant’ white blood cells which ‘gobble up’ bacteria etc. However,\\nin doing so, this could cause inﬂammation and in extreme\\ncircumstances be fatal. She says these aﬀects are mitigated by Type 2\\nmacrophages which kick in to calm down the system and stop it\\ngoing rogue. They clear up dead tissue debris and reduce\\ninﬂammation that the Type 1 ‘ﬁre crews’ have caused. Type 1 kills\\nthe infection and Type 2 heals the damage, she says. This is her\\npunchline with regard to ‘Covid vaccinations’: She says that mRNA\\n‘antibodies’ block Type 2 macrophages by a\\x00aching to them and\\ndeactivating them. This meant that when the Type 1 response was\\ntriggered by infection there was nothing to stop that ge\\x00ing out of\\nhand by calming everything down. There’s an on-switch, but no oﬀ-\\nswitch, she says. What follows can be ‘over and out, see you when I\\nsee you’.\\nGenetic suicide\\nTenpenny also highlights the potential for autoimmune disease – the\\nbody a\\x00acking itself – which has been associated with vaccines since\\nthey ﬁrst appeared. Infusing a synthetic foreign substance into cells\\ncould cause the immune system to react in a panic believing that the\\nbody is being overwhelmed by an invader (it is) and the\\nconsequences can again be fatal. There is an autoimmune response\\nknown as a ‘cytokine storm’ which I have likened to a homeowner\\npanicked by an intruder and picking up a gun to shoot randomly in\\nall directions before turning the ﬁre on himself. The immune system\\nunleashes a storm of inﬂammatory response called cytokines to a\\nthreat and the body commits hara-kiri. The lesson is that you mess\\nwith the body’s immune response at your peril and these ‘vaccines’\\nseriously – fundamentally – mess with immune response. Tenpenny\\nrefers to a consequence called anaphylactic shock which is a severe\\nand highly dangerous allergic reaction when the immune system ﬂoods the body with chemicals. She gives the example of having a\\nbee sting which primes the immune system and makes it sensitive to\\nthose chemicals. When people are stung again maybe years later the\\nimmune response can be so powerful that it leads to anaphylactic\\nshock. Tenpenny relates this ‘shock’ with regard to the ‘Covid\\nvaccine’ to something called polyethylene glycol or PEG. Enormous\\nnumbers of people have become sensitive to this over decades of use\\nin a whole range of products and processes including food, drink,\\nskin creams and ‘medicine’. Studies have claimed that some 72\\npercent of people have antibodies triggered by PEG compared with\\ntwo percent in the 1960s and allergic hypersensitive reactions to this\\nbecome a gathering cause for concern. Tenpenny points out that the\\n‘mRNA vaccine’ is coated in a ‘bubble’ of polyethylene glycol which\\nhas the potential to cause anaphylactic shock through immune\\nsensitivity. Many reports have appeared of people reacting this way\\na\\x00er having the ‘Covid vaccine’. What do we think is going to\\nhappen as humanity has more and more of these ‘vaccines’?\\nTenpenny said: ‘All these pictures we have seen with people with\\nthese rashes … these weepy rashes, big reactions on their arms and\\nthings like that – it’s an acute allergic reaction most likely to the\\npolyethylene glycol that you’ve been previously primed and\\nsensitised to.’\\nThose who have not studied the conspiracy and its perpetrators at\\nlength might think that making the population sensitive to PEG and\\nthen pu\\x00ing it in these ‘vaccines’ is just a coincidence. It is not. It is\\ninstead testament to how carefully and coldly-planned current\\nevents have been and the scale of the conspiracy we are dealing\\nwith. Tenpenny further explains that the ‘vaccine’ mRNA procedure\\ncan breach the blood-brain barrier which protects the brain from\\ntoxins and other crap that will cause malfunction. In this case they\\ncould make two proteins corrupt brain function to cause\\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) , a progressive nervous system\\ndisease leading to loss of muscle control, and frontal lobe\\ndegeneration – Alzheimer’s and dementia. Immunologist J. Bart\\nClasson published a paper connecting mRNA ‘vaccines’ to prion disease which can lead to Alzheimer’s and other forms of\\nneurogenerative disease while others have pointed out the potential\\nto aﬀect the placenta in ways that make women infertile. This will\\nbecome highly signiﬁcant in the next chapter when I will discuss\\nother aspects of this non-vaccine that relate to its nanotechnology\\nand transmission from the injected to the uninjected.\\nQualified in idiocy\\nTenpenny describes how research has conﬁrmed that these ‘vaccine’-\\ngenerated antibodies can interact with a range of other tissues in the\\nbody and a\\x00ack many other organs including the lungs. ‘This means\\nthat if you have a hundred people standing in front of you that all\\ngot this shot they could have a hundred diﬀerent symptoms.’\\nAnyone really think that Cult gofers like the Queen, Tony Blair,\\nChristopher Whi\\x00y, Anthony Fauci, and all the other psychopaths\\nhave really had this ‘vaccine’ in the pictures we’ve seen? Not a\\nbloody chance. Why don’t doctors all tell us about all these dangers\\nand consequences of the ‘Covid vaccine’? Why instead do they\\nencourage and pressure patients to have the shot? Don’t let’s think\\nfor a moment that doctors and medical staﬀ can’t be stupid, lazy, and\\npsychopathic and that’s without the ﬁnancial incentives to give the\\njab. Tenpenny again:\\nSome people are going to die from the vaccine directly but a large number of people are\\ngoing to start to get horribly sick and get all kinds of autoimmune diseases 42 days to maybe a\\nyear out. What are they going to do, these stupid doctors who say; ‘Good for you for getting\\nthat vaccine.’ What are they going to say; ‘Oh, it must be a mutant, we need to give an extra\\ndose of that vaccine.’\\nBecause now the vaccine, instead of one dose or two doses we need three or four because the\\nstupid physicians aren’t taking the time to learn anything about it. If I can learn this sitting in\\nmy living room reading a 19 page paper and several others so can they. There’s nothing\\nspecial about me, I just take the time to do it.\\nRemember how Sara Kayat, the NHS and TV doctor, said that the\\n‘Covid vaccine’ would ‘100 percent prevent hospitalisation and\\ndeath’. Doctors can be idiots like every other profession and they should not be worshipped as infallible. They are not and far from it.\\nBehind many medical and scientiﬁc ‘experts’ lies an uninformed prat\\ntrying to hide themselves from you although in the ‘Covid’ era many\\nhave failed to do so as with UK narrative-repeating ‘TV doctor’\\nHilary Jones. Pushing back against the minority of proper doctors\\nand scientists speaking out against the ‘vaccine’ has been the entire\\nediﬁce of the Cult global state in the form of governments, medical\\nsystems, corporations, mainstream media, Silicon Valley, and an\\narmy of compliant doctors, medical staﬀ and scientists willing to say\\nanything for money and to enhance their careers by promoting the\\nparty line. If you do that you are an ‘expert’ and if you won’t you are\\nan ‘anti-vaxxer’ and ‘Covidiot’. The pressure to be ‘vaccinated’ is\\nincessant. We have even had reports claiming that the ‘vaccine’ can\\nhelp cure cancer and Alzheimer’s and make the lame walk. I am\\nwaiting for the announcement that it can bring you coﬀee in the\\nmorning and cook your tea. Just as the symptoms of ‘Covid’ seem to\\nincrease by the week so have the miracles of the ‘vaccine’. American\\nsupermarket giant Kroger Co. oﬀered nearly 500,000 employees in\\n35 states a $100 bonus for having the ‘vaccine’ while donut chain\\nKrispy Kreme promised ‘vaccinated’ customers a free glazed donut\\nevery day for the rest of 2021. Have your DNA changed and you will\\nget a doughnut although we might not have to give you them for\\nlong. Such oﬀers and incentives conﬁrm the desperation.\\nPerhaps the worse vaccine-stunt of them all was UK ‘Health’\\nSecretary Ma\\x00-the-prat Hancock on live TV a\\x00er watching a clip of\\nsomeone being ‘vaccinated’ when the roll-out began. Hancock faked\\ntears so badly it was embarrassing. Brain-of-Britain Piers Morgan,\\nthe lockdown-supporting, ‘vaccine’ supporting, ‘vaccine’ passport-\\nsupporting, TV host played along with Hancock – ‘You’re quite\\nemotional about that’ he said in response to acting so atrocious it\\nwould have been called out at a school nativity which will\\npresumably today include Mary and Jesus in masks, wise men\\nkeeping their camels six feet apart, and shepherds under tent arrest.\\nSystem-serving Morgan tweeted this: ‘Love the idea of covid vaccine\\npassports for everywhere: ﬂights, restaurants, clubs, football, gyms, shops etc. It’s time covid-denying, anti-vaxxer loonies had their\\nbullsh*t bluﬀ called & bar themselves from going anywhere that\\nresponsible citizens go.’ If only I could aspire to his genius. To think\\nthat Morgan, who specialises in shouting over anyone he disagrees\\nwith, was lauded as a free speech hero when he lost his job a\\x00er\\nstorming oﬀ the set of his live show like a child throwing his dolly\\nout of the pram. If he is a free speech hero we are in real trouble. I\\nhave no idea what ‘bullsh*t’ means, by the way, the * throws me\\ncompletely.\\nThe Cult is desperate to infuse its synthetic DNA-changing\\nconcoction into everyone and has been using every lie, trick and\\nintimidation to do so. The question of ‘Why?’ we shall now address. I\\nCHAPTER TEN\\nHuman 2.0\\nI believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general\\neducated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to\\nspeak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted –\\nAlan Turing (1912-1954), the ‘Father of artificial intelligence‘\\nhave been exposing for decades the plan to transform the human\\nbody from a biological to a synthetic-biological state. The new\\nhuman that I will call Human 2.0 is planned to be connected to\\nartiﬁcial intelligence and a global AI ‘Smart Grid’ that would operate\\nas one global system in which AI would control everything from\\nyour fridge to your heating system to your car to your mind.\\nHumans would no longer be ‘human’, but post-human and sub-\\nhuman, with their thinking and emotional processes replaced by AI.\\nWhat I said sounded crazy and beyond science ﬁction and I could\\nunderstand that. To any balanced, rational, mind it is crazy. Today,\\nhowever, that world is becoming reality and it puts the ‘Covid\\nvaccine’ into its true context. Ray Kurzweil is the ultra-Zionist\\n‘computer scientist, inventor and futurist’ and co-founder of the\\nSingularity University. Singularity refers to the merging of humans\\nwith machines or ‘transhumanism’. Kurzweil has said humanity\\nwould be connected to the cyber ‘cloud’ in the period of the ever-\\nrecurring year of 2030:\\nOur thinking … will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking … humans will be\\nable to extend their limitations and ‘think in the cloud’ … We’re going to put gateways to the cloud in our brains ... We’re going to gradually merge and enhance ourselves ... In my view,\\nthat’s the nature of being human – we transcend our limitations. As the technology becomes\\nvastly superior to what we are then the small proportion that is still human gets smaller and\\nsmaller and smaller until it’s just utterly negligible.\\nThey are trying to sell this end-of-humanity-as-we-know-it as the\\nnext stage of ‘evolution’ when we become super-human and ‘like the\\ngods’. They are lying to you. Shocked, eh? The population, and again\\nespecially the young, have been manipulated into addiction to\\ntechnologies designed to enslave them for life. First they induced an\\naddiction to smartphones (holdables); next they moved to\\ntechnology on the body (wearables); and then began the invasion of\\nthe body (implantables). I warned way back about the plan for\\nmicrochipped people and we are now entering that era. We should\\nnot be diverted into thinking that this refers only to chips we can see.\\nMost important are the nanochips known as smart dust, neural dust\\nand nanobots which are far too small to be seen by the human eye.\\nNanotechnology is everywhere, increasingly in food products, and\\nreleased into the atmosphere by the geoengineering of the skies\\nfunded by Bill Gates to ‘shut out the Sun’ and ‘save the planet from\\nglobal warming’. Gates has been funding a project to spray millions\\nof tonnes of chalk (calcium carbonate) into the stratosphere over\\nSweden to ‘dim the Sun’ and cool the Earth. Scientists warned the\\nmove could be disastrous for weather systems in ways no one can\\npredict and opposition led to the Swedish space agency announcing\\nthat the ‘experiment’ would not be happening as planned in the\\nsummer of 2021; but it shows where the Cult is going with dimming\\nthe impact of the Sun and there’s an associated plan to change the\\nplanet’s atmosphere. Who gives psychopath Gates the right to\\ndictate to the entire human race and dismantle planetary systems?\\nThe world will not be safe while this man is at large.\\nThe global warming hoax has made the Sun, like the gas of life,\\nsomething to fear when both are essential to good health and human\\nsurvival (more inversion). The body transforms sunlight into vital\\nvitamin D through a process involving … cholesterol. This is the\\ncholesterol we are also told to fear. We are urged to take Big Pharma statin drugs to reduce cholesterol and it’s all systematic. Reducing\\ncholesterol means reducing vitamin D uptake with all the multiple\\nhealth problems that will cause. At least if you take statins long term\\nit saves the government from having to pay you a pension. The\\ndelivery system to block sunlight is widely referred to as chemtrails\\nalthough these have a much deeper agenda, too. They appear at ﬁrst\\nto be contrails or condensation trails streaming from aircra\\x00 into\\ncold air at high altitudes. Contrails disperse very quickly while\\nchemtrails do not and spread out across the sky before eventually\\ntheir content falls to earth. Many times I have watched aircra\\x00 cross-\\ncross a clear blue sky releasing chemtrails until it looks like a cloudy\\nday. Chemtrails contain many things harmful to humans and the\\nnatural world including toxic heavy metals, aluminium (see\\nAlzheimer’s) and nanotechnology. Ray Kurzweil reveals the reason\\nwithout actually saying so: ‘Nanobots will infuse all the ma\\x00er\\naround us with information. Rocks, trees, everything will become\\nthese intelligent creatures.’ How do you deliver that? From the sky.\\nSelf-replicating nanobots would connect everything to the Smart\\nGrid. The phenomenon of Morgellons disease began in the chemtrail\\nera and the correlation has led to it being dubbed the ‘chemtrail\\ndisease’. Self-replicating ﬁbres appear in the body that can be pulled\\nout through the skin. Morgellons ﬁbres continue to grow outside the\\nbody and have a form of artiﬁcial intelligence. I cover this at greater\\nlength in Phantom Self.\\n‘Vaccine’ operating system\\n‘Covid vaccines’ with their self-replicating synthetic material are also\\ndesigned to make the connection between humanity and Kurzweil’s\\n‘cloud’. American doctor and dedicated campaigner for truth, Carrie\\nMadej, an Internal Medicine Specialist in Georgia with more than 20\\nyears medical experience, has highlighted the nanotechnology aspect\\nof the fake ‘vaccines’. She explains how one of the components in at\\nleast the Moderna and Pﬁzer synthetic potions are ‘lipid\\nnanoparticles’ which are ‘like li\\x00le tiny computer bits’ – a ‘sci-ﬁ\\nsubstance’ known as nanobots and hydrogel which can be ‘triggered at any moment to deliver its payload’ and act as ‘biosensors’. The\\nsynthetic substance had ‘the ability to accumulate data from your\\nbody like your breathing, your respiration, thoughts and emotions,\\nall kind of things’ and each syringe could carry a million nanobots:\\nThis substance because it’s like little bits of computers in your body, crazy, but it’s true, it can\\ndo that, [and] obviously has the ability to act through Wi-Fi. It can receive and transmit\\nenergy, messages, frequencies or impulses. That issue has never been addressed by these\\ncompanies. What does that do to the human?\\nJust imagine getting this substance in you and it can react to things all around you, the 5G,\\nyour smart device, your phones, what is happening with that? What if something is triggering\\nit, too, like an impulse, a frequency? We have something completely foreign in the human\\nbody.\\nMadej said her research revealed that electromagnetic (EMF)\\nfrequencies emi\\x00ed by phones and other devices had increased\\ndramatically in the same period of the ‘vaccine’ rollout and she was\\nseeing more people with radiation problems as 5G and other\\nelectromagnetic technology was expanded and introduced to schools\\nand hospitals. She said she was ‘ﬂoored with the EMF coming oﬀ’\\nthe devices she checked. All this makes total sense and syncs with\\nmy own work of decades when you think that Moderna refers in\\ndocuments to its mRNA ‘vaccine’ as an ‘operating system’:\\nRecognizing the broad potential of mRNA science, we set out to create an mRNA technology\\nplatform that functions very much like an operating system on a computer. It is designed so\\nthat it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs. In our case, the ‘program’\\nor ‘app’ is our mRNA drug – the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein …\\n… Our MRNA Medicines – ‘The ‘Software Of Life’: When we have a concept for a new\\nmRNA medicine and begin research, fundamental components are already in place.\\nGenerally, the only thing that changes from one potential mRNA medicine to another is the\\ncoding region – the actual genetic code that instructs ribosomes to make protein. Utilizing\\nthese instruction sets gives our investigational mRNA medicines a software-like quality. We\\nalso have the ability to combine different mRNA sequences encoding for different proteins in\\na single mRNA investigational medicine. Who needs a real ‘virus’ when you can create a computer version to\\njustify infusing your operating system into the entire human race on\\nthe road to making living, breathing people into cyborgs? What is\\nmissed with the ‘vaccines’ is the digital connection between synthetic\\nmaterial and the body that I highlighted earlier with the study that\\nhacked a computer with human DNA. On one level the body is\\ndigital, based on mathematical codes, and I’ll have more about that\\nin the next chapter. Those who ridiculously claim that mRNA\\n‘vaccines’ are not designed to change human genetics should explain\\nthe words of Dr Tal Zaks, chief medical oﬃcer at Moderna, in a 2017\\nTED talk. He said that over the last 30 years ‘we’ve been living this\\nphenomenal digital scientiﬁc revolution, and I’m here today to tell\\nyou, that we are actually hacking the software of life, and that it’s\\nchanging the way we think about prevention and treatment of\\ndisease’:\\nIn every cell there’s this thing called messenger RNA, or mRNA for short, that transmits the\\ncritical information from the DNA in our genes to the protein, which is really the stuff we’re\\nall made out of. This is the critical information that determines what the cell will do. So we\\nthink about it as an operating system. So if you could change that, if you could introduce a\\nline of code, or change a line of code, it turns out, that has profound implications for\\neverything, from the flu to cancer.\\nZaks should more accurately have said that this has profound\\nimplications for the human genetic code and the nature of DNA.\\nCommunications within the body go both ways and not only one.\\nBut, hey, no, the ‘Covid vaccine’ will not aﬀect your genetics. Cult\\nfact-checkers say so even though the man who helped to develop the\\nmRNA technique says that it does. Zaks said in 2017:\\nIf you think about what it is we’re trying to do. We’ve taken information and our\\nunderstanding of that information and how that information is transmitted in a cell, and we’ve\\ntaken our understanding of medicine and how to make drugs, and we’re fusing the two. We\\nthink of it as information therapy.\\nI have been writing for decades that the body is an information\\nﬁeld communicating with itself and the wider world. This is why radiation which is information can change the information ﬁeld of\\nbody and mind through phenomena like 5G and change their nature\\nand function. ‘Information therapy’ means to change the body’s\\ninformation ﬁeld and change the way it operates. DNA is a receiver-\\ntransmi\\x00er of information and can be mutated by information like\\nmRNA synthetic messaging. Technology to do this has been ready\\nand waiting in the underground bases and other secret projects to be\\nrolled out when the ‘Covid’ hoax was played. ‘Trials’ of such short\\nand irrelevant duration were only for public consumption. When\\nthey say the ‘vaccine’ is ‘experimental’ that is not true. It may appear\\nto be ‘experimental’ to those who don’t know what’s going on, but\\nthe trials have already been done to ensure the Cult gets the result it\\ndesires. Zaks said that it took decades to sequence the human\\ngenome, completed in 2003, but now they could do it in a week. By\\n‘they’ he means scientists operating in the public domain. In the\\nsecret projects they were sequencing the genome in a week long\\nbefore even 2003.\\nDeluge of mRNA\\nHighly signiﬁcantly the Moderna document says the guiding\\npremise is that if using mRNA as a medicine works for one disease\\nthen it should work for many diseases. They were leveraging the\\nﬂexibility aﬀorded by their platform and the fundamental role\\nmRNA plays in protein synthesis to pursue mRNA medicines for a\\nbroad spectrum of diseases. Moderna is conﬁrming what I was\\nsaying through 2020 that multiple ‘vaccines’ were planned for\\n‘Covid’ (and later invented ‘variants’) and that previous vaccines\\nwould be converted to the mRNA system to infuse the body with\\nmassive amounts of genetically-manipulating synthetic material to\\nsecure a transformation to a synthetic-biological state. The ‘vaccines’\\nare designed to kill stunning numbers as part of the long-exposed\\nCult depopulation agenda and transform the rest. Given this is the\\ngoal you can appreciate why there is such hysterical demand for\\nevery human to be ‘vaccinated’ for an alleged ‘disease’ that has an\\nestimated ‘infection’ to ‘death’ ratio of 0.23-0.15 percent. As I write •\\n•\\n•\\nchildren are being given the ‘vaccine’ in trials (their parents are a\\ndisgrace) and ever-younger people are being oﬀered the vaccine for\\na ‘virus’ that even if you believe it exists has virtually zero chance of\\nharming them. Horriﬁc eﬀects of the ‘trials’ on a 12-year-old girl\\nwere revealed by a family member to be serious brain and gastric\\nproblems that included a bowel obstruction and the inability to\\nswallow liquids or solids. She was unable to eat or drink without\\nthrowing up, had extreme pain in her back, neck and abdomen, and\\nwas paralysed from the waist down which stopped her urinating\\nunaided. When the girl was ﬁrst taken to hospital doctors said it was\\nall in her mind. She was signed up for the ‘trial’ by her parents for\\nwhom no words suﬃce. None of this ‘Covid vaccine’ insanity makes\\nany sense unless you see what the ‘vaccine’ really is – a body-\\nchanger. Synthetic biology or ‘SynBio’ is a fast-emerging and\\nexpanding scientiﬁc discipline which includes everything from\\ngenetic and molecular engineering to electrical and computer\\nengineering. Synthetic biology is deﬁned in these ways:\\nA multidisciplinary area of research that seeks to create new\\nbiological parts, devices, and systems, or to redesign systems that\\nare already found in nature.\\nThe use of a mixture of physical engineering and genetic\\nengineering to create new (and therefore synthetic) life forms.\\nAn emerging ﬁeld of research that aims to combine the\\nknowledge and methods of biology, engineering and related\\ndisciplines in the design of chemically-synthesized DNA to create\\norganisms with novel or enhanced characteristics and traits\\n(synthetic organisms including humans).\\nWe now have synthetic blood, skin, organs and limbs being\\ndeveloped along with synthetic body parts produced by 3D printers.\\nThese are all elements of the synthetic human programme and this\\ncomment by Kurzweil’s co-founder of the Singularity University, Peter Diamandis, can be seen in a whole new light with the ‘Covid’\\nhoax and the sanctions against those that refuse the ‘vaccine’:\\nAnybody who is going to be resisting the progress forward [to transhumanism] is going to be\\nresisting evolution and, fundamentally, they will die out. It’s not a matter of whether it’s good\\nor bad. It’s going to happen.\\n‘Resisting evolution’? What absolute bollocks. The arrogance of these\\npeople is without limit. His ‘it’s going to happen’ mantra is another\\nway of saying ‘resistance is futile’ to break the spirit of those pushing\\nback and we must not fall for it. Ge\\x00ing this genetically-\\ntransforming ‘vaccine’ into everyone is crucial to the Cult plan for\\ntotal control and the desperation to achieve that is clear for anyone\\nto see. Vaccine passports are a major factor in this and they, too, are a\\nform of resistance is futile. It’s NOT. The paper funded by the\\nRockefeller Foundation for the 2013 ‘health conference’ in China\\nsaid:\\nWe will interact more with artificial intelligence. The use of robotics, bio-engineering to\\naugment human functioning is already well underway and will advance. Re-engineering of\\nhumans into potentially separate and unequal forms through genetic engineering or mixed\\nhuman-robots raises debates on ethics and equality.\\nA new demography is projected to emerge after 2030 [that year again] of technologies\\n(robotics, genetic engineering, nanotechnology) producing robots, engineered organisms,\\n‘nanobots’ and artificial intelligence (AI) that can self-replicate. Debates will grow on the\\nimplications of an impending reality of human designed life.\\nWhat is happening today is so long planned. The world army\\nenforcing the will of the world government is intended to be a robot\\narmy, not a human one. Today’s military and its technologically\\n‘enhanced’ troops, pilotless planes and driverless vehicles are just\\nstepping stones to that end. Human soldiers are used as Cult fodder\\nand its time they woke up to that and worked for the freedom of the\\npopulation instead of their own destruction and their family’s\\ndestruction – the same with the police. Join us and let’s sort this out.\\nThe phenomenon of enforce my own destruction is widespread in\\nthe ‘Covid’ era with Woker ‘luvvies’ in the acting and entertainment industries supporting ‘Covid’ rules which have destroyed their\\nprofession and the same with those among the public who put signs\\non the doors of their businesses ‘closed due to Covid – stay safe’\\nwhen many will never reopen. It’s a form of masochism and most\\ncertainly insanity.\\nTransgender = transhumanism\\nWhen something explodes out of nowhere and is suddenly\\neverywhere it is always the Cult agenda and so it is with the tidal\\nwave of claims and demands that have inﬁltrated every aspect of\\nsociety under the heading of ‘transgenderism’. The term ‘trans’ is so\\n‘in’ and this is the dictionary deﬁnition:\\nA prefix meaning ‘across’, ’through’, occurring … in loanwords from Latin, used in particular\\nfor denoting movement or conveyance from place to place (transfer; transmit; transplant) or\\ncomplete change (transform; transmute), or to form adjectives meaning ’crossing’, ‘on the\\nother side of’, or ‘going beyond’ the place named (transmontane; transnational; trans-\\nSiberian).\\nTransgender means to go beyond gender and transhuman means\\nto go beyond human. Both are aspects of the Cult plan to transform\\nthe human body to a synthetic state with no gender. Human 2.0 is not\\ndesigned to procreate and would be produced technologically with\\nno need for parents. The new human would mean the end of parents\\nand so men, and increasingly women, are being targeted for the\\ndeletion of their rights and status. Parental rights are disappearing at\\nan ever-quickening speed for the same reason. The new human\\nwould have no need for men or women when there is no procreation\\nand no gender. Perhaps the transgender movement that appears to\\nbe in a permanent state of frenzy might now contemplate on how it\\nis being used. This was never about transgender rights which are\\nonly the interim excuse for confusing gender, particularly in the\\nyoung, on the road to fusing gender. Transgender activism is not an\\nend; it is a means to an end. We see again the technique of creative\\ndestruction in which you destroy the status quo to ‘build back be\\x00er’\\nin the form that you want. The gender status quo had to be destroyed by persuading the Cult-created Woke mentality to believe\\nthat you can have 100 genders or more. A programme for 9 to 12\\nyear olds produced by the Cult-owned BBC promoted the 100\\ngenders narrative. The very idea may be the most monumental\\nnonsense, but it is not what is true that counts, only what you can\\nmake people believe is true. Once the gender of 2 + 2 = 4 has been\\ndismantled through indoctrination, intimidation and 2 + 2 = 5 then\\nthe new no-gender normal can take its place with Human 2.0.\\nAldous Huxley revealed the plan in his prophetic Brave New World in\\n1932:\\nNatural reproduction has been done away with and children are created, decanted’, and\\nraised in ‘hatcheries and conditioning centres’. From birth, people are genetically designed to\\nfit into one of five castes, which are further split into ‘Plus’ and ‘Minus’ members and designed\\nto fulfil predetermined positions within the social and economic strata of the World State.\\nHow could Huxley know this in 1932? For the same reason George\\nOrwell knew about the Big Brother state in 1948, Cult insiders I have\\nquoted knew about it in 1969, and I have known about it since the\\nearly 1990s. If you are connected to the Cult or you work your balls\\noﬀ to uncover the plan you can predict the future. The process is\\nsimple. If there is a plan for the world and nothing intervenes to stop\\nit then it will happen. Thus if you communicate the plan ahead of\\ntime you are perceived to have predicted the future, but you haven’t.\\nYou have revealed the plan which without intervention will become\\nthe human future. The whole reason I have done what I have is to\\nalert enough people to inspire an intervention and maybe at last that\\ntime has come with the Cult and its intentions now so obvious to\\nanyone with a brain in working order.\\nThe future is here\\nTechnological wombs that Huxley described to replace parent\\nprocreation are already being developed and they are only the\\nprojects we know about in the public arena. Israeli scientists told The\\nTimes of Israel in March, 2021, that they have grown 250-cell embryos into mouse foetuses with fully formed organs using artiﬁcial wombs\\nin a development they say could pave the way for gestating humans\\noutside the womb. Professor Jacob Hanna of the Weizmann Institute\\nof Science said:\\nWe took mouse embryos from the mother at day five of development, when they are just of\\n250 cells, and had them in the incubator from day five until day 11, by which point they had\\ngrown all their organs.\\nBy day 11 they make their own blood and have a beating heart, a fully developed brain.\\nAnybody would look at them and say, ‘this is clearly a mouse foetus with all the\\ncharacteristics of a mouse.’ It’s gone from being a ball of cells to being an advanced foetus.\\nA special liquid is used to nourish embryo cells in a laboratory\\ndish and they ﬂoat on the liquid to duplicate the ﬁrst stage of\\nembryonic development. The incubator creates all the right\\nconditions for its development, Hanna said. The liquid gives the\\nembryo ‘all the nutrients, hormones and sugars they need’ along\\nwith a custom-made electronic incubator which controls gas\\nconcentration, pressure and temperature. The cu\\x00ing-edge in the\\nunderground bases and other secret locations will be light years\\nahead of that, however, and this was reported by the London\\nGuardian in 2017:\\nWe are approaching a biotechnological breakthrough. Ectogenesis, the invention of a\\ncomplete external womb, could completely change the nature of human reproduction. In\\nApril this year, researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia announced their\\ndevelopment of an artificial womb.\\nThe article was headed ‘Artiﬁcial wombs could soon be a reality.\\nWhat will this mean for women?’ What would it mean for children is\\nan even bigger question. No mother to bond with only a machine in\\npreparation for a life of soulless interaction and control in a world\\ngoverned by machines (see the Matrix movies). Now observe the\\ncalculated manipulations of the ‘Covid’ hoax as human interaction\\nand warmth has been curtailed by distancing, isolation and fear with\\npeople communicating via machines on a scale never seen before. These are all dots in the same picture as are all the personal\\nassistants, gadgets and children’s toys through which kids and\\nadults communicate with AI as if it is human. The AI ‘voice’ on Sat-\\nNav should be included. All these things are psychological\\npreparation for the Cult endgame. Before you can make a physical\\nconnection with AI you have to make a psychological connection\\nand that is what people are being conditioned to do with this ever\\ngathering human-AI interaction. Movies and TV programmes\\ndepicting the transhuman, robot dystopia relate to a phenomenon\\nknown as ‘pre-emptive programming’ in which the world that is\\nplanned is portrayed everywhere in movies, TV and advertising.\\nThis is conditioning the conscious and subconscious mind to become\\nfamiliar with the planned reality to dilute resistance when it\\nhappens for real. What would have been a shock such is the change\\nis made less so. We have young children put on the road to\\ntransgender transition surgery with puberty blocking drugs at an\\nage when they could never be able to make those life-changing\\ndecisions.\\nRachel Levine, a professor of paediatrics and psychiatry who\\nbelieves in treating children this way, became America’s highest-\\nranked openly-transgender oﬃcial when she was conﬁrmed as US\\nAssistant Secretary at the Department of Health and Human\\nServices a\\x00er being nominated by Joe Biden (the Cult). Activists and\\ngovernments press for laws to deny parents a say in their children’s\\ntransition process so the kids can be isolated and manipulated into\\nagreeing to irreversible medical procedures. A Canadian father\\nRobert Hoogland was denied bail by the Vancouver Supreme Court\\nin 2021 and remained in jail for breaching a court order that he stay\\nsilent over his young teenage daughter, a minor, who was being\\noﬀered life-changing hormone therapy without parental consent. At\\nthe age of 12 the girl’s ‘school counsellor’ said she may be\\ntransgender, referred her to a doctor and told the school to treat her\\nlike a boy. This is another example of state-serving schools imposing\\never more control over children’s lives while parents have ever less. Contemptible and extreme child abuse is happening all over the\\nworld as the Cult gender-fusion operation goes into warp-speed.\\nWhy the war on men – and now women?\\nThe question about what artiﬁcial wombs mean for women should\\nrightly be asked. The answer can be seen in the deletion of women’s\\nrights involving sport, changing rooms, toilets and status in favour\\nof people in male bodies claiming to identify as women. I can\\nidentify as a mountain climber, but it doesn’t mean I can climb a\\nmountain any more than a biological man can be a biological\\nwoman. To believe so is a triumph of belief over factual reality which\\nis the very perceptual basis of everything Woke. Women’s sport is\\nbeing destroyed by allowing those with male bodies who say they\\nidentify as female to ‘compete’ with girls and women. Male body\\n‘women’ dominate ‘women’s’ competition with their greater muscle\\nmass, bone density, strength and speed. With that disadvantage\\nsport for women loses all meaning. To put this in perspective nearly\\n300 American high school boys can run faster than the quickest\\nwoman sprinter in the world. Women are seeing their previously\\nprotected spaces invaded by male bodies simply because they claim\\nto identify as women. That’s all they need to do to access all women’s\\nspaces and activities under the Biden ‘Equality Act’ that destroys\\nequality for women with the usual Orwellian Woke inversion. Male\\nsex oﬀenders have already commi\\x00ed rapes in women’s prisons a\\x00er\\nclaiming to identify as women to get them transferred. Does this not\\nma\\x00er to the Woke ‘equality’ hypocrites? Not in the least. What\\nma\\x00ers to Cult manipulators and funders behind transgender\\nactivists is to advance gender fusion on the way to the no-gender\\n‘human’. When you are seeking to impose transparent nonsense like\\nthis, or the ‘Covid’ hoax, the only way the nonsense can prevail is\\nthrough censorship and intimidation of dissenters, deletion of\\nfactual information, and programming of the unquestioning,\\nbewildered and naive. You don’t have to scan the world for long to\\nsee that all these things are happening. Many women’s rights organisations have realised that rights and\\nstatus which took such a long time to secure are being eroded and\\nthat it is systematic. Kara Dansky of the global Women’s Human\\nRights Campaign said that Biden’s transgender executive order\\nimmediately he took oﬃce, subsequent orders, and Equality Act\\nlegislation that followed ‘seek to erase women and girls in the law as\\na category’. Exactly. I said during the long ago-started war on men\\n(in which many women play a crucial part) that this was going to\\nturn into a war on them. The Cult is phasing out both male and\\nfemale genders. To get away with that they are brought into conﬂict\\nso they are busy ﬁghting each other while the Cult completes the job\\nwith no unity of response. Unity, people, unity. We need unity\\neverywhere. Transgender is the only show in town as the big step\\ntowards the no-gender human. It’s not about rights for transgender\\npeople and never has been. Woke political correctness is deleting\\nwords relating to genders to the same end. Wokers believe this is to\\nbe ‘inclusive’ when the opposite is true. They are deleting words\\ndescribing gender because gender itself is being deleted by Human\\n2.0. Terms like ‘man’, ‘woman’, ‘mother’ and ‘father’ are being\\ndeleted in the universities and other institutions to be replaced by\\nthe no-gender, not trans-gender, ‘individuals’ and ‘guardians’.\\nWomen’s rights campaigner Maria Keﬄer of Partners for Ethical\\nCare said: ‘Children are being taught from kindergarten upward that\\nsome boys have a vagina, some girls have a penis, and that kids can\\nbe any gender they want to be.’ Do we really believe that suddenly\\ncountries all over the world at the same time had the idea of having\\ndrag queens go into schools or read transgender stories to very\\nyoung children in the local library? It’s coldly-calculated confusion\\nof gender on the way to the fusion of gender. Suzanne Vierling, a\\npsychologist from Southern California, made another important\\npoint:\\nYesterday’s slave woman who endured gynecological medical experiments is today’s girl-\\nchild being butchered in a booming gender-transitioning sector. Ovaries removed, pushing her\\ninto menopause and osteoporosis, uncharted territory, and parents’ rights and authority\\ndecimated. The erosion of parental rights is a common theme in line with the\\nCult plans to erase the very concept of parents and ‘ovaries removed,\\npushing her into menopause’ means what? Those born female lose\\nthe ability to have children – another way to discontinue humanity\\nas we know it.\\nEliminating Human 1.0 (before our very eyes)\\nTo pave the way for Human 2.0 you must phase out Human 1.0. This\\nis happening through plummeting sperm counts and making\\nwomen infertile through an onslaught of chemicals, radiation\\n(including smartphones in pockets of men) and mRNA ‘vaccines’.\\nCommon agriculture pesticides are also having a devastating impact\\non human fertility. I have been tracking collapsing sperm counts in\\nthe books for a long time and in 2021 came a book by fertility\\nscientist and reproductive epidemiologist Shanna Swan, Count\\nDown: How Our Modern World Is Threatening Sperm Counts, Altering\\nMale and Female Reproductive Development and Imperiling the Future of\\nthe Human Race. She reports how the global fertility rate dropped by\\nhalf between 1960 and 2016 with America’s birth rate 16 percent\\nbelow where it needs to be to sustain the population. Women are\\nexperiencing declining egg quality, more miscarriages, and more\\ncouples suﬀer from infertility. Other ﬁndings were an increase in\\nerectile dysfunction, infant boys developing more genital\\nabnormalities, male problems with conception, and plunging levels\\nof the male hormone testosterone which would explain why so\\nmany men have lost their backbone and masculinity. This has been\\nvery evident during the ‘Covid’ hoax when women have been\\nprominent among the Pushbackers and big strapping blokes have\\nbowed their heads, covered their faces with a nappy and quietly\\nsubmi\\x00ed. Mind control expert Cathy O’Brien also points to how\\nglobal education introduced the concept of ‘we’re all winners’ in\\nsport and classrooms: ‘Competition was defused, and it in turn\\ndefused a sense of ﬁghting back.’ This is another version of the\\n‘equity’ doctrine in which you drive down rather than raise up.\\nWhat a contrast in Cult-controlled China with its global ambitions where the government published plans in January, 2021, to ‘cultivate\\nmasculinity’ in boys from kindergarten through to high school in the\\nface of a ‘masculinity crisis’. A government adviser said boys would\\nbe soon become ‘delicate, timid and eﬀeminate’ unless action was\\ntaken. Don’t expect any similar policy in the targeted West. A 2006\\nstudy showed that a 65-year-old man in 2002 had testosterone levels\\n15 percent lower than a 65-year-old man in 1987 while a 2020 study\\nfound a similar story with young adults and adolescents. Men are\\nge\\x00ing prescriptions for testosterone replacement therapy which\\ncauses an even greater drop in sperm count with up to 99 percent\\nseeing sperm counts drop to zero during the treatment. More sperm\\nis defective and malfunctioning with some having two heads or not\\npursuing an egg.\\nA class of synthetic chemicals known as phthalates are being\\nblamed for the decline. These are found everywhere in plastics,\\nshampoos, cosmetics, furniture, ﬂame retardants, personal care\\nproducts, pesticides, canned foods and even receipts. Why till\\nreceipts? Everyone touches them. Let no one delude themselves that\\nall this is not systematic to advance the long-time agenda for human\\nbody transformation. Phthalates mimic hormones and disrupt the\\nhormone balance causing testosterone to fall and genital birth\\ndefects in male infants. Animals and ﬁsh have been aﬀected in the\\nsame way due to phthalates and other toxins in rivers. When ﬁsh\\nturn gay or change sex through chemicals in rivers and streams it is\\na pointer to why there has been such an increase in gay people and\\nthe sexually confused. It doesn’t ma\\x00er to me what sexuality people\\nchoose to be, but if it’s being aﬀected by chemical pollution and\\nconsumption then we need to know. Does anyone really think that\\nthis is not connected to the transgender agenda, the war on men and\\nthe condemnation of male ‘toxic masculinity’? You watch this being\\nfollowed by ‘toxic femininity’. It’s already happening. When\\nbreastfeeding becomes ‘chest-feeding’, pregnant women become\\npregnant people along with all the other Woke claptrap you know\\nthat the world is going insane and there’s a Cult scam in progress.\\nTransgender activists are promoting the Cult agenda while Cult billionaires support and fund the insanity as they laugh themselves\\nto sleep at the sheer stupidity for which humans must be infamous\\nin galaxies far, far away.\\n‘Covid vaccines’ and female infertility\\nWe can now see why the ‘vaccine’ has been connected to potential\\ninfertility in women. Dr Michael Yeadon, former Vice President and\\nChief Scientiﬁc Advisor at Pﬁzer, and Dr Wolfgang Wodarg in\\nGermany, ﬁled a petition with the European Medicines Agency in\\nDecember, 2020, urging them to stop trials for the Pﬁzer/BioNTech\\nshot and all other mRNA trials until further studies had been done.\\nThey were particularly concerned about possible eﬀects on fertility\\nwith ‘vaccine’-produced antibodies a\\x00acking the protein Syncytin-1\\nwhich is responsible for developing the placenta. The result would\\nbe infertility ‘of indeﬁnite duration’ in women who have the\\n‘vaccine’ with the placenta failing to form. Section 10.4.2 of the\\nPﬁzer/BioNTech trial protocol says that pregnant women or those\\nwho might become so should not have mRNA shots. Section 10.4\\nwarns men taking mRNA shots to ‘be abstinent from heterosexual\\nintercourse’ and not to donate sperm. The UK government said that\\nit did not know if the mRNA procedure had an eﬀect on fertility. Did\\nnot know? These people have to go to jail. UK government advice did\\nnot recommend at the start that pregnant women had the shot and\\nsaid they should avoid pregnancy for at least two months a\\x00er\\n‘vaccination’. The ‘advice’ was later updated to pregnant women\\nshould only have the ‘vaccine’ if the beneﬁts outweighed the risks to\\nmother and foetus. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Then\\n‘spontaneous abortions’ began to appear and rapidly increase on the\\nadverse reaction reporting schemes which include only a fraction of\\nadverse reactions. Thousands and ever-growing numbers of\\n‘vaccinated’ women are describing changes to their menstrual cycle\\nwith heavier blood ﬂow, irregular periods and menstruating again\\na\\x00er going through the menopause – all links to reproduction\\neﬀects. Women are passing blood clots and the lining of their uterus\\nwhile men report erectile dysfunction and blood eﬀects. Most signiﬁcantly of all unvaccinated women began to report similar\\nmenstrual changes a\\x00er interaction with ‘vaccinated’ people and men\\nand children were also aﬀected with bleeding noses, blood clots and\\nother conditions. ‘Shedding’ is when vaccinated people can emit the\\ncontent of a vaccine to aﬀect the unvaccinated, but this is diﬀerent.\\n‘Vaccinated’ people were not shedding a ‘live virus’ allegedly in\\n‘vaccines’ as before because the fake ‘Covid vaccines’ involve\\nsynthetic material and other toxicity. Doctors exposing what is\\nhappening prefer the term ‘transmission’ to shedding. Somehow\\nthose that have had the shots are transmi\\x00ing eﬀects to those that\\nhaven’t. Dr Carrie Madej said the nano-content of the ‘vaccines’ can\\n‘act like an antenna’ to others around them which ﬁts perfectly with\\nmy own conclusions. This ‘vaccine’ transmission phenomenon was\\nbecoming known as the book went into production and I deal with\\nthis further in the Postscript.\\nVaccine eﬀects on sterility are well known. The World Health\\nOrganization was accused in 2014 of sterilising millions of women in\\nKenya with the evidence conﬁrmed by the content of the vaccines\\ninvolved. The same WHO behind the ‘Covid’ hoax admi\\x00ed its\\ninvolvement for more than ten years with the vaccine programme.\\nOther countries made similar claims. Charges were lodged by\\nTanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines. The Gardasil\\nvaccine claimed to protect against a genital ‘virus’ known as HPV\\nhas also been linked to infertility. Big Pharma and the WHO (same\\nthing) are criminal and satanic entities. Then there’s the Bill Gates\\nFoundation which is connected through funding and shared\\ninterests with 20 pharmaceutical giants and laboratories. He stands\\naccused of directing the policy of United Nations Children’s Fund\\n(UNICEF), vaccine alliance GAVI, and other groupings, to advance\\nthe vaccine agenda and silence opposition at great cost to women\\nand children. At the same time Gates wants to reduce the global\\npopulation. Coincidence?\\nGreat Reset = Smart Grid = new human The Cult agenda I have been exposing for 30 years is now being\\nopenly promoted by Cult assets like Gates and Klaus Schwab of the\\nWorld Economic Forum under code-terms like the ‘Great Reset’,\\n‘Build Back Be\\x00er’ and ‘a rare but narrow window of opportunity to\\nreﬂect, reimagine, and reset our world’. What provided this ‘rare but\\nnarrow window of opportunity’? The ‘Covid’ hoax did. Who created\\nthat? They did. My books from not that long ago warned about the\\nplanned ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) and its implications for human\\nfreedom. This was the plan to connect all technology to the Internet\\nand artiﬁcial intelligence and today we are way down that road with\\nan estimated 36 billion devices connected to the World Wide Web\\nand that ﬁgure is projected to be 76 billion by 2025. I further warned\\nthat the Cult planned to go beyond that to the Internet of Everything\\nwhen the human brain was connected via AI to the Internet and\\nKurzweil’s ‘cloud’. Now we have Cult operatives like Schwab calling\\nfor precisely that under the term ‘Internet of Bodies’, a fusion of the\\nphysical, digital and biological into one centrally-controlled Smart\\nGrid system which the Cult refers to as the ‘Fourth Industrial\\nRevolution’. They talk about the ‘biological’, but they really mean\\nthe synthetic-biological which is required to fully integrate the\\nhuman body and brain into the Smart Grid and artiﬁcial intelligence\\nplanned to replace the human mind. We have everything being\\nsynthetically manipulated including the natural world through\\nGMO and smart dust, the food we eat and the human body itself\\nwith synthetic ‘vaccines’. I said in The Answer that we would see the\\nCult push for synthetic meat to replace animals and in February,\\n2021, the so predictable psychopath Bill Gates called for the\\nintroduction of synthetic meat to save us all from ‘climate change’.\\nThe climate hoax just keeps on giving like the ‘Covid’ hoax. The war\\non meat by vegan activists is a carbon (oops, sorry) copy of the\\nmanipulation of transgender activists. They have no idea (except\\ntheir inner core) that they are being used to promote and impose the\\nagenda of the Cult or that they are only the vehicle and not the reason.\\nThis is not to say those who choose not to eat meat shouldn’t be\\nrespected and supported in that right, but there are ulterior motives •\\n•\\n•\\nfor those in power. A Forbes article in December, 2019, highlighted\\nthe plan so beloved of Schwab and the Cult under the heading:\\n‘What Is The Internet of Bodies? And How Is It Changing Our\\nWorld?’ The article said the human body is the latest data platform\\n(remember ‘our vaccine is an operating system’). Forbes described\\nthe plan very accurately and the words could have come straight out\\nof my books from long before:\\nThe Internet of Bodies (IoB) is an extension of the IoT and basically connects the human body\\nto a network through devices that are ingested, implanted, or connected to the body in some\\nway. Once connected, data can be exchanged, and the body and device can be remotely\\nmonitored and controlled.\\nThey were really describing a human hive mind with human\\nperception centrally-dictated via an AI connection as well as\\nallowing people to be ‘remotely monitored and controlled’.\\nEverything from a fridge to a human mind could be directed from a\\ncentral point by these insane psychopaths and ‘Covid vaccines’ are\\ncrucial to this. Forbes explained the process I mentioned earlier of\\nholdable and wearable technology followed by implantable. The\\narticle said there were three generations of the Internet of Bodies that\\ninclude:\\nBody external: These are wearable devices such as Apple Watches\\nor Fitbits that can monitor our health.\\nBody internal: These include pacemakers, cochlear implants, and\\ndigital pills that go inside our bodies to monitor or control various\\naspects of health.\\nBody embedded: The third generation of the Internet of Bodies is\\nembedded technology where technology and the human body are\\nmelded together and have a real-time connection to a remote\\nmachine. Forbes noted the development of the Brain Computer Interface (BCI)\\nwhich merges the brain with an external device for monitoring and\\ncontrolling in real-time. ‘The ultimate goal is to help restore function\\nto individuals with disabilities by using brain signals rather than\\nconventional neuromuscular pathways.’ Oh, do fuck oﬀ. The goal of\\nbrain interface technology is controlling human thought and\\nemotion from the central point in a hive mind serving its masters\\nwishes. Many people are now agreeing to be chipped to open doors\\nwithout a key. You can recognise them because they’ll be wearing a\\nmask, social distancing and lining up for the ‘vaccine’. The Cult\\nplans a Great Reset money system a\\x00er they have completed the\\ndemolition of the global economy in which ‘money’ will be\\nexchanged through communication with body operating systems.\\nRand Corporation, a Cult-owned think tank, said of the Internet of\\nBodies or IoB:\\nInternet of Bodies technologies fall under the broader IoT umbrella. But as the name suggests,\\nIoB devices introduce an even more intimate interplay between humans and gadgets. IoB\\ndevices monitor the human body, collect health metrics and other personal information, and\\ntransmit those data over the Internet. Many devices, such as fitness trackers, are already in use\\n… IoB devices … and those in development can track, record, and store users’ whereabouts,\\nbodily functions, and what they see, hear, and even think.\\nSchwab’s World Economic Forum, a long-winded way of saying\\n‘fascism’ or ‘the Cult’, has gone full-on with the Internet of Bodies in\\nthe ‘Covid’ era. ‘We’re entering the era of the Internet of Bodies’, it\\ndeclared, ‘collecting our physical data via a range of devices that can\\nbe implanted, swallowed or worn’. The result would be a huge\\namount of health-related data that could improve human wellbeing\\naround the world, and prove crucial in ﬁghting the ‘Covid-19\\npandemic’. Does anyone think these clowns care about ‘human\\nwellbeing’ a\\x00er the death and devastation their pandemic hoax has\\npurposely caused? Schwab and co say we should move forward with\\nthe Internet of Bodies because ‘Keeping track of symptoms could\\nhelp us stop the spread of infection, and quickly detect new cases’.\\nHow wonderful, but keeping track’ is all they are really bothered about. Researchers were investigating if data gathered from\\nsmartwatches and similar devices could be used as viral infection\\nalerts by tracking the user’s heart rate and breathing. Schwab said in\\nhis 2018 book Shaping the Future of the Fourth Industrial Revolution:\\nThe lines between technologies and beings are becoming blurred and not just by the ability to\\ncreate lifelike robots or synthetics. Instead it is about the ability of new technologies to literally\\nbecome part of us. Technologies already influence how we understand ourselves, how we\\nthink about each other, and how we determine our realities. As the technologies … give us\\ndeeper access to parts of ourselves, we may begin to integrate digital technologies into our\\nbodies.\\nYou can see what the game is. Twenty-four hour control and people\\n– if you could still call them that – would never know when\\nsomething would go ping and take them out of circulation. It’s the\\nmost obvious rush to a global fascist dictatorship and the complete\\nsubmission of humanity and yet still so many are locked away in\\ntheir Cult-induced perceptual coma and can’t see it.\\nSmart Grid control centres\\nThe human body is being transformed by the ‘vaccines’ and in other\\nways into a synthetic cyborg that can be a\\x00ached to the global Smart\\nGrid which would be controlled from a central point and other sub-\\nlocations of Grid manipulation. Where are these planned to be? Well,\\nChina for a start which is one of the Cult’s biggest centres of\\noperation. The technological control system and technocratic rule\\nwas incubated here to be unleashed across the world a\\x00er the\\n‘Covid’ hoax came out of China in 2020. Another Smart Grid location\\nthat will surprise people new to this is Israel. I have exposed in The\\nTrigger how Sabbatian technocrats, intelligence and military\\noperatives were behind the horrors of 9/11 and not `19 Arab hĳackers’\\nwho somehow manifested the ability to pilot big passenger airliners\\nwhen instructors at puddle-jumping ﬂying schools described some\\nof them as a joke. The 9/11 a\\x00acks were made possible through\\ncontrol of civilian and military air computer systems and those of the\\nWhite House, Pentagon and connected agencies. See The Trigger – it will blow your mind. The controlling and coordinating force were\\nthe Sabbatian networks in Israel and the United States which by then\\nhad inﬁltrated the entire US government, military and intelligence\\nsystem. The real name of the American Deep State is ‘Sabbatian\\nState’. Israel is a tiny country of only nine million people, but it is\\none of the global centres of cyber operations and fast catching Silicon\\nValley in importance to the Cult. Israel is known as the ‘start-up\\nnation’ for all the cyber companies spawned there with the\\nSabbatian specialisation of ‘cyber security’ that I mentioned earlier\\nwhich gives those companies access to computer systems of their\\nclients in real time through ‘backdoors’ wri\\x00en into the coding when\\nsecurity so\\x00ware is downloaded. The Sabbatian centre of cyber\\noperations outside Silicon Valley is the Israeli military Cyber\\nIntelligence Unit, the biggest infrastructure project in Israel’s history,\\nheadquartered in the desert-city of Beersheba and involving some\\n20,000 ‘cyber soldiers’. Here are located a literal army of Internet\\ntrolls scanning social media, forums and comment lists for anyone\\nchallenging the Cult agenda. The UK military has something similar\\nwith its 77th Brigade and associated operations. The Beersheba\\ncomplex includes research and development centres for other Cult\\noperations such as Intel, Microso\\x00, IBM, Google, Apple, Hewle\\x00-\\nPackard, Cisco Systems, Facebook and Motorola. Techcrunch.com\\nran an article about the Beersheba global Internet technology centre\\nheadlined ‘Israel’s desert city of Beersheba is turning into a cybertech\\noasis’:\\nThe military’s massive relocation of its prestigious technology units, the presence of\\nmultinational and local companies, a close proximity to Ben Gurion University and generous\\ngovernment subsidies are turning Beersheba into a major global cybertech hub. Beersheba has\\nall of the ingredients of a vibrant security technology ecosystem, including Ben Gurion\\nUniversity with its graduate program in cybersecurity and Cyber Security Research Center, and\\nthe presence of companies such as EMC, Deutsche Telekom, PayPal, Oracle, IBM, and\\nLockheed Martin. It’s also the future home of the INCB (Israeli National Cyber Bureau); offers\\na special income tax incentive for cyber security companies, and was the site for the\\nrelocation of the army’s intelligence corps units. Sabbatians have taken over the cyber world through the following\\nprocess: They scan the schools for likely cyber talent and develop\\nthem at Ben Gurion University and their period of conscription in\\nthe Israeli Defense Forces when they are stationed at the Beersheba\\ncomplex. When the cyber talented oﬃcially leave the army they are\\nfunded to start cyber companies with technology developed by\\nthemselves or given to them by the state. Much of this is stolen\\nthrough backdoors of computer systems around the world with\\nAmerica top of the list. Others are sent oﬀ to Silicon Valley to start\\ncompanies or join the major ones and so we have many major\\npositions ﬁlled by apparently ‘Jewish’ but really Sabbatian\\noperatives. Google, YouTube and Facebook are all run by ‘Jewish’\\nCEOs while Twi\\x00er is all but run by ultra-Zionist hedge-fund shark\\nPaul Singer. At the centre of the Sabbatian global cyber web is the\\nIsraeli army’s Unit 8200 which specialises in hacking into computer\\nsystems of other countries, inserting viruses, gathering information,\\ninstigating malfunction, and even taking control of them from a\\ndistance. A long list of Sabbatians involved with 9/11, Silicon Valley\\nand Israeli cyber security companies are operatives of Unit 8200.\\nThis is not about Israel. It’s about the Cult. Israel is planned to be a\\nSmart Grid hub as with China and what is happening at Beersheba is\\nnot for the beneﬁt of Jewish people who are treated disgustingly by\\nthe Sabbatian elite that control the country. A glance at the\\nNuremberg Codes will tell you that.\\nThe story is much bigger than ‘Covid’, important as that is to\\nwhere we are being taken. Now, though, it’s time to really strap in.\\nThere’s more … much more … I\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\\nWho controls the Cult?\\nAwake, arise or be forever fall’n\\nJohn Milton, Paradise Lost\\nhave exposed this far the level of the Cult conspiracy that operates\\nin the world of the seen and within the global secret society and\\nsatanic network which operates in the shadows one step back from\\nthe seen. The story, however, goes much deeper than that.\\nThe ‘Covid’ hoax is major part of the Cult agenda, but only part,\\nand to grasp the biggest picture we have to expand our a\\x00ention\\nbeyond the realm of human sight and into the inﬁnity of possibility\\nthat we cannot see. It is from here, ultimately, that humanity is being\\nmanipulated into a state of total control by the force which dictates\\nthe actions of the Cult. How much of reality can we see? Next to\\ndamn all is the answer. We may appear to see all there is to see in the\\n‘space’ our eyes survey and observe, but li\\x00le could be further from\\nthe truth. The human ‘world’ is only a tiny band of frequency that\\nthe body’s visual and perceptual systems can decode into perception\\nof a ‘world’. According to mainstream science the electromagnetic\\nspectrum is 0.005 percent of what exists in the Universe (Fig 10). The\\nmaximum estimate I have seen is 0.5 percent and either way it’s\\nminiscule. I say it is far, far, smaller even than 0.005 percent when\\nyou compare reality we see with the totality of reality that we don’t.\\nNow get this if you are new to such information: Visible light, the\\nonly band of frequency that we can see, is a fraction of the 0.005 percent (Fig 11 overleaf). Take this further and realise that our\\nuniverse is one of inﬁnite universes and that universes are only a\\nfragment of overall reality – infinite reality. Then compare that with\\nthe almost inﬁnitesimal frequency band of visible light or human\\nsight. You see that humans are as near blind as it is possible to be\\nwithout actually being so. Artist and ﬁlmmaker, Sergio Toporek,\\nsaid:\\nFigure 10: Humans can perceive such a tiny band of visual reality it’s laughable.\\nFigure 11: We can see a smear of the 0.005 percent electromagnetic spectrum, but we still\\nknow it all. Yep, makes sense.\\nConsider that you can see less than 1% of the electromagnetic spectrum and hear less than\\n1% of the acoustic spectrum. 90% of the cells in your body carry their own microbial DNA\\nand are not ‘you’. The atoms in your body are 99.9999999999999999% empty space and\\nnone of them are the ones you were born with ... Human beings have 46 chromosomes, two\\nless than a potato. The existence of the rainbow depends on the conical photoreceptors in your eyes; to animals\\nwithout cones, the rainbow does not exist. So you don’t just look at a rainbow, you create it.\\nThis is pretty amazing, especially considering that all the beautiful colours you see represent\\nless than 1% of the electromagnetic spectrum.\\nSuddenly the ‘world’ of humans looks a very diﬀerent place. Take\\ninto account, too, that Planet Earth when compared with the\\nprojected size of this single universe is the equivalent of a billionth of\\na pinhead. Imagine the ratio that would be when compared to\\ninﬁnite reality. To think that Christianity once insisted that Earth and\\nhumanity were the centre of everything. This background is vital if\\nwe are going to appreciate the nature of ‘human’ and how we can be\\nmanipulated by an unseen force. To human visual reality virtually\\neverything is unseen and yet the prevailing perception within the\\ninstitutions and so much of the public is that if we can’t see it, touch\\nit, hear it, taste it and smell it then it cannot exist. Such perception is\\nindoctrinated and encouraged by the Cult and its agents because it\\nisolates believers in the strictly limited, village-idiot, realm of the ﬁve\\nsenses where perceptions can be ﬁrewalled and information\\ncontrolled. Most of those perpetuating the ‘this-world-is-all-there-is’\\ninsanity are themselves indoctrinated into believing the same\\ndelusion. While major players and inﬂuencers know that oﬃcial\\nreality is laughable most of those in science, academia and medicine\\nreally believe the nonsense they peddle and teach succeeding\\ngenerations. Those who challenge the orthodoxy are dismissed as\\nnu\\x00ers and freaks to protect the manufactured illusion from\\nexposure. Observe the dynamic of the ‘Covid’ hoax and you will see\\nhow that takes the same form. The inner-circle psychopaths knows\\nit’s a gigantic scam, but almost the entirety of those imposing their\\nfascist rules believe that ‘Covid’ is all that they’re told it is.\\nStolen identity\\nAsk people who they are and they will give you their name, place of\\nbirth, location, job, family background and life story. Yet that is not\\nwho they are – it is what they are experiencing. The diﬀerence is\\nabsolutely crucial. The true ‘I’, the eternal, inﬁnite ‘I’, is consciousness, a state of being aware. Forget ‘form’. That is a vehicle for a brief\\nexperience. Consciousness does not come from the brain, but through\\nthe brain and even that is more symbolic than literal. We are\\nawareness, pure awareness, and this is what withdraws from the\\nbody at what we call ‘death’ to continue our eternal beingness,\\nisness, in other realms of reality within the limitlessness of inﬁnity or\\nthe Biblical ‘many mansions in my father’s house’. Labels of a\\nhuman life, man, woman, transgender, black, white, brown,\\nnationality, circumstances and income are not who we are. They are\\nwhat we are – awareness – is experiencing in a brief connection with a\\nband of frequency we call ‘human’. The labels are not the self; they\\nare, to use the title of one of my books, a Phantom Self. I am not\\nDavid Icke born in Leicester, England, on April 29th, 1952. I am the\\nconsciousness having that experience. The Cult and its non-human\\nmasters seek to convince us through the institutions of ‘education’,\\nscience, medicine, media and government that what we are\\nexperiencing is who we are. It’s so easy to control and direct\\nperception locked away in the bewildered illusions of the ﬁve senses\\nwith no expanded radar. Try, by contrast, doing the same with a\\nhumanity aware of its true self and its true power to consciously\\ncreate its reality and experience. How is it possible to do this? We do\\nit all day every day. If you perceive yourself as ‘li\\x00le me’ with no\\npower to impact upon your life and the world then your life\\nexperience will reﬂect that. You will hand the power you don’t think\\nyou have to authority in all its forms which will use it to control your\\nexperience. This, in turn, will appear to conﬁrm your perception of\\n‘li\\x00le me’ in a self-fulﬁlling feedback loop. But that is what ‘li\\x00le me’\\nreally is – a perception. We are all ‘big-me’, inﬁnite me, and the Cult\\nhas to make us forget that if its will is to prevail. We are therefore\\nmanipulated and pressured into self-identifying with human labels\\nand not the consciousness/awareness experiencing those human\\nlabels.\\nThe phenomenon of identity politics is a Cult-instigated\\nmanipulation technique to sub-divide previous labels into even\\nsmaller ones. A United States university employs this list of le\\x00ers to describe student identity: LGBTTQQFAGPBDSM or lesbian, gay,\\nbisexual, transgender, transsexual, queer, questioning, ﬂexual,\\nasexual, gender-fuck, polyamorous, bondage/discipline,\\ndominance/submission and sadism/masochism. I’m sure other lists\\nare even longer by now as people feel the need to self-identity the ‘I’\\nwith the minutiae of race and sexual preference. Wokers\\nprogrammed by the Cult for generations believe this is about\\n‘inclusivity’ when it’s really the Cult locking them away into smaller\\nand smaller versions of Phantom Self while ﬁrewalling them from\\nthe inﬂuence of their true self, the inﬁnite, eternal ‘I’. You may notice\\nthat my philosophy which contends that we are all unique points of\\na\\x00ention/awareness within the same inﬁnite whole or Oneness is the\\nultimate non-racism. The very sense of Oneness makes the\\njudgement of people by their body-type, colour or sexuality u\\x00erly\\nridiculous and conﬁrms that racism has no understanding of reality\\n(including anti-white racism). Yet despite my perception of life Cult\\nagents and fast-asleep Wokers label me racist to discredit my\\ninformation while they are themselves phenomenally racist and\\nsexist. All they see is race and sexuality and they judge people as\\ngood or bad, demons or untouchables, by their race and sexuality.\\nAll they see is Phantom Self and perceive themselves in terms of\\nPhantom Self. They are pawns and puppets of the Cult agenda to\\nfocus a\\x00ention and self-identity in the ﬁve senses and play those\\nidentities against each other to divide and rule. Columbia University\\nhas introduced segregated graduations in another version of social\\ndistancing designed to drive people apart and teach them that\\ndiﬀerent racial and cultural groups have nothing in common with\\neach other. The last thing the Cult wants is unity. Again the pump-\\nprimers of this will be Cult operatives in the knowledge of what they\\nare doing, but the rest are just the Phantom Self blind leading the\\nPhantom Self blind. We do have something in common – we are all\\nthe same consciousness having diﬀerent temporary experiences.\\nWhat is this ‘human’? Yes, what is ‘human’? That is what we are supposed to be, right? I\\nmean ‘human’? True, but ‘human’ is the experience not the ‘I’. Break\\nit down to basics and ‘human’ is the way that information is\\nprocessed. If we are to experience and interact with this band of\\nfrequency we call the ‘world’ we must have a vehicle that operates\\nwithin that band of frequency. Our consciousness in its prime form\\ncannot do that; it is way beyond the frequency of the human realm.\\nMy consciousness or awareness could not tap these keys and pick up\\nthe cup in front of me in the same way that radio station A cannot\\ninteract with radio station B when they are on diﬀerent frequencies.\\nThe human body is the means through which we have that\\ninteraction. I have long described the body as a biological computer\\nwhich processes information in a way that allows consciousness to\\nexperience this reality. The body is a receiver, transmi\\x00er and\\nprocessor of information in a particular way that we call human. We\\nvisually perceive only the world of the ﬁve senses in a wakened state\\n– that is the limit of the body’s visual decoding system. In truth it’s\\nnot even visual in the way we experience ‘visual reality’ as I will\\ncome to in a moment. We are ‘human’ because the body processes\\nthe information sources of human into a reality and behaviour\\nsystem that we perceive as human. Why does an elephant act like an\\nelephant and not like a human or a duck? The elephant’s biological\\ncomputer is a diﬀerent information ﬁeld and processes information\\naccording to that program into a visual and behaviour type we call\\nan elephant. The same applies to everything in our reality. These\\nbody information ﬁelds are perpetuated through procreation (like\\nmaking a copy of a so\\x00ware program). The Cult wants to break that\\ncycle and intervene technologically to transform the human\\ninformation ﬁeld into one that will change what we call humanity. If\\nit can change the human information ﬁeld it will change the way\\nthat ﬁeld processes information and change humanity both\\n‘physically’ and psychologically. Hence the messenger (information)\\nRNA ‘vaccines’ and so much more that is targeting human genetics\\nby changing the body’s information – messaging – construct through\\nfood, drink, radiation, toxicity and other means. Reality that we experience is nothing like reality as it really is in\\nthe same way that the reality people experience in virtual reality\\ngames is not the reality they are really living in. The game is only a\\ndecoded source of information that appears to be a reality. Our\\nworld is also an information construct – a simulation (more later). In\\nits base form our reality is a waveﬁeld of information much the same\\nin theme as Wi-Fi. The ﬁve senses decode waveﬁeld information into\\nelectrical information which they communicate to the brain to\\ndecode into holographic (illusory ‘physical’) information. Diﬀerent\\nparts of the brain specialise in decoding diﬀerent senses and the\\ninformation is fused into a reality that appears to be outside of us\\nbut is really inside the brain and the genetic structure in general (Fig\\n12 overleaf). DNA is a receiver-transmi\\x00er of information and a vital\\npart of this decoding process and the body’s connection to other\\nrealities. Change DNA and you change the way we decode and\\nconnect with reality – see ‘Covid vaccines’. Think of computers\\ndecoding Wi-Fi. You have information encoded in a radiation ﬁeld\\nand the computer decodes that information into a very diﬀerent\\nform on the screen. You can’t see the Wi-Fi until its information is\\nmade manifest on the screen and the information on the screen is\\ninside the computer and not outside. I have just described how we\\ndecode the ‘human world’. All ﬁve senses decode the waveform ‘Wi-\\nFi’ ﬁeld into electrical signals and the brain (computer) constructs\\nreality inside the brain and not outside – ‘You don’t just look at a\\nrainbow, you create it’. Sound is a simple example. We don’t hear\\nsound until the brain decodes it. Waveform sound waves are picked\\nup by the hearing sense and communicated to the brain in an\\nelectrical form to be decoded into the sounds that we hear.\\nEverything we hear is inside the brain along with everything we see,\\nfeel, smell and taste. Words and language are waveform ﬁelds\\ngenerated by our vocal chords which pass through this process until\\nthey are decoded by the brain into words that we hear. Diﬀerent\\nlanguages are diﬀerent frequency ﬁelds or sound waves generated\\nby vocal chords. Late British philosopher Alan Wa\\x00s said: Figure 12: The brain receives information from the five senses and constructs from that our\\nperceived reality.\\n[Without the brain] the world is devoid of light, heat, weight, solidity, motion, space, time or\\nany other imaginable feature. All these phenomena are interactions, or transactions, of\\nvibrations with a certain arrangement of neurons.\\nThat’s exactly what they are and scientist Robert Lanza describes in\\nhis book, Biocentrism, how we decode electromagnetic waves and\\nenergy into visual and ‘physical’ experience. He uses the example of\\na ﬂame emi\\x00ing photons, electromagnetic energy, each pulsing\\nelectrically and magnetically:\\n… these … invisible electromagnetic waves strike a human retina, and if (and only if) the\\nwaves happen to measure between 400 and 700 nano meters in length from crest to crest,\\nthen their energy is just right to deliver a stimulus to the 8 million cone-shaped cells in the\\nretina.\\nEach in turn send an electrical pulse to a neighbour neuron, and on up the line this goes, at\\n250 mph, until it reaches the … occipital lobe of the brain, in the back of the head. There, a\\ncascading complex of neurons fire from the incoming stimuli, and we subjectively perceive\\nthis experience as a yellow brightness occurring in a place we have been conditioned to call\\nthe ‘external world’.\\nYou hear what you decode If a tree falls or a building collapses they make no noise unless\\nsomeone is there to decode the energetic waves generated by the\\ndisturbance into what we call sound. Does a falling tree make a\\nnoise? Only if you hear it – decode it. Everything in our reality is a\\nfrequency ﬁeld of information operating within the overall ‘Wi-Fi’\\nﬁeld that I call The Field. A vibrational disturbance is generated in\\nThe Field by the ﬁelds of the falling tree or building. These\\ndisturbance waves are what we decode into the sound of them\\nfalling. If no one is there to do that then neither will make any noise.\\nReality is created by the observer – decoder – and the perceptions of\\nthe observer aﬀect the decoding process. For this reason diﬀerent\\npeople – diﬀerent perceptions – will perceive the same reality or\\nsituation in a diﬀerent way. What one may perceive as a nightmare\\nanother will see as an opportunity. The question of why the Cult is\\nso focused on controlling human perception now answers itself. All\\nexperienced reality is the act of decoding and we don’t experience\\nWi-Fi until it is decoded on the computer screen. The sight and\\nsound of an Internet video is encoded in the Wi-Fi all around us, but\\nwe don’t see or hear it until the computer decodes that information.\\nTaste, smell and touch are all phenomena of the brain as a result of\\nthe same process. We don’t taste, smell or feel anything except in the\\nbrain and there are pain relief techniques that seek to block the\\nsignal from the site of discomfort to the brain because if the brain\\ndoesn’t decode that signal we don’t feel pain. Pain is in the brain and\\nonly appears to be at the point of impact thanks to the feedback loop\\nbetween them. We don’t see anything until electrical information\\nfrom the sight senses is decoded in an area at the back of the brain. If\\nthat area is damaged we can go blind when our eyes are perfectly\\nokay. So why do we go blind if we damage an eye? We damage the\\ninformation processing between the waveform visual information\\nand the visual decoding area of the brain. If information doesn’t\\nreach the brain in a form it can decode then we can’t see the visual\\nreality that it represents. What’s more the brain is decoding only a\\nfraction of the information it receives and the rest is absorbed by the sub-conscious mind. This explanation is from the science magazine,\\nWonderpedia:\\nEvery second, 11 million sensations crackle along these [brain] pathways ... The brain is\\nconfronted with an alarming array of images, sounds and smells which it rigorously filters\\ndown until it is left with a manageable list of around 40. Thus 40 sensations per second make\\nup what we perceive as reality.\\nThe ‘world’ is not what people are told to believe that is it and the\\ninner circles of the Cult know that.\\nIllusory ‘physical’ reality\\nWe can only see a smear of 0.005 percent of the Universe which is\\nonly one of a vast array of universes – ‘mansions’ – within inﬁnite\\nreality. Even then the brain decodes only 40 pieces of information\\n(‘sensations’) from a potential 11 million that we receive every\\nsecond. Two points strike you from this immediately: The sheer\\nbreathtaking stupidity of believing we know anything so rigidly that\\nthere’s nothing more to know; and the potential for these processes\\nto be manipulated by a malevolent force to control the reality of the\\npopulation. One thing I can say for sure with no risk of contradiction\\nis that when you can perceive an almost indescribable fraction of\\ninﬁnite reality there is always more to know as in tidal waves of it.\\nAncient Greek philosopher Socrates was so right when he said that\\nwisdom is to know how li\\x00le we know. How obviously true that is\\nwhen you think that we are experiencing a physical world of solidity\\nthat is neither physical nor solid and a world of apartness when\\neverything is connected. Cult-controlled ‘science’ dismisses the so-\\ncalled ‘paranormal’ and all phenomena related to that when the\\n‘para’-normal is perfectly normal and explains the alleged ‘great\\nmysteries’ which dumbfound scientiﬁc minds. There is a reason for\\nthis. A ‘scientiﬁc mind’ in terms of the mainstream is a material\\nmind, a ﬁve-sense mind imprisoned in see it, touch it, hear it, smell it\\nand taste it. Phenomena and happenings that can’t be explained that\\nway leave the ‘scientiﬁc mind’ bewildered and the rule is that if they can’t account for why something is happening then it can’t, by\\ndeﬁnition, be happening. I beg to diﬀer. Telepathy is thought waves\\npassing through The Field (think wave disturbance again) to be\\ndecoded by someone able to connect with that wavelength\\n(information). For example: You can pick up the thought waves of a\\nfriend at any distance and at the very least that will bring them to\\nmind. A few minutes later the friend calls you. ‘My god’, you say,\\n‘that’s incredible – I was just thinking of you.’ Ah, but they were\\nthinking of you before they made the call and that’s what you\\ndecoded. Native peoples not entrapped in ﬁve-sense reality do this\\nso well it became known as the ‘bush telegraph’. Those known as\\npsychics and mediums (genuine ones) are doing the same only\\nacross dimensions of reality. ‘Mind over ma\\x00er’ comes from the fact\\nthat ma\\x00er and mind are the same. The state of one inﬂuences the\\nstate of the other. Indeed one and the other are illusions. They are\\naspects of the same ﬁeld. Paranormal phenomena are all explainable\\nso why are they still considered ‘mysteries’ or not happening? Once\\nyou go down this road of understanding you begin to expand\\nawareness beyond the ﬁve senses and that’s the nightmare for the\\nCult.\\nFigure 13: Holograms are not solid, but the best ones appear to be. Figure 14: How holograms are created by capturing a waveform version of the subject image.\\nHolographic ‘solidity’\\nOur reality is not solid, it is holographic. We are now well aware of\\nholograms which are widely used today. Two-dimensional\\ninformation is decoded into a three-dimensional reality that is not\\nsolid although can very much appear to be (Fig 13). Holograms are\\ncreated with a laser divided into two parts. One goes directly onto a\\nholographic photographic print (‘reference beam’) and the other\\ntakes a waveform image of the subject (‘working beam’) before being\\ndirected onto the print where it ‘collides’ with the other half of the\\nlaser (Fig 14). This creates a waveform interference pa\\x00ern which\\ncontains the waveﬁeld information of whatever is being\\nphotographed (Fig 15 overleaf). The process can be likened to\\ndropping pebbles in a pond. Waves generated by each one spread\\nout across the water to collide with the others and create a wave\\nrepresentation of where the stones fell and at what speed, weight\\nand distance. A waveform interference pa\\x00ern of a hologram is akin\\nto the waveform information in The Field which the ﬁve senses\\ndecode into electrical signals to be decoded by the brain into a\\nholographic illusory ‘physical’ reality. In the same way when a laser\\n(think human a\\x00ention) is directed at the waveform interference\\npa\\x00ern a three-dimensional version of the subject is projected into\\napparently ‘solid’ reality (Fig 16). An amazing trait of holograms\\nreveals more ‘paranormal mysteries’. Information of the whole hologram is encoded in waveform in every part of the interference\\npa\\x00ern by the way they are created. This means that every part of a\\nhologram is a smaller version of the whole. Cut the interference\\nwave-pa\\x00ern into four and you won’t get four parts of the image.\\nYou get quarter-sized versions of the whole image. The body is a\\nhologram and the same applies. Here we have the basis of\\nacupuncture, reﬂexology and other forms of healing which identify\\nrepresentations of the whole body in all of the parts, hands, feet,\\nears, everywhere. Skilled palm readers can do what they do because\\nthe information of whole body is encoded in the hand. The concept\\nof as above, so below, comes from this.\\nFigure 15: A waveform interference pattern that holds the information that transforms into a\\nhologram.\\nFigure 16: Holographic people including ‘Elvis’ holographically inserted to sing a duet with\\nCeline Dion. The question will be asked of why, if solidity is illusory, we can’t\\njust walk through walls and each other. The resistance is not solid\\nagainst solid; it is electromagnetic ﬁeld against electromagnetic ﬁeld\\nand we decode this into the experience of solid against solid. We\\nshould also not underestimate the power of belief to dictate reality.\\nWhat you believe is impossible will be. Your belief impacts on your\\ndecoding processes and they won’t decode what you think is\\nimpossible. What we believe we perceive and what we perceive we\\nexperience. ‘Can’t dos’ and ‘impossibles’ are like a ﬁrewall in a\\ncomputer system that won’t put on the screen what the ﬁrewall\\nblocks. How vital that is to understanding how human experience\\nhas been hĳacked. I explain in The Answer, Everything You Need To\\nKnow But Have Never Been Told and other books a long list of\\n‘mysteries’ and ‘paranormal’ phenomena that are not mysterious\\nand perfectly normal once you realise what reality is and how it\\nworks. ‘Ghosts’ can be seen to pass through ‘solid’ walls because the\\nwalls are not solid and the ghost is a discarnate entity operating on a\\nfrequency so diﬀerent to that of the wall that it’s like two radio\\nstations sharing the same space while never interfering with each\\nother. I have seen ghosts do this myself. The apartness of people and\\nobjects is also an illusion. Everything is connected by the Field like\\nall sea life is connected by the sea. It’s just that within the limits of\\nour visual reality we only ‘see’ holographic information and not the\\nﬁeld of information that connects everything and from which the\\nholographic world is made manifest. If you can only see holographic\\n‘objects’ and not the ﬁeld that connects them they will appear to you\\nas unconnected to each other in the same way that we see the\\ncomputer while not seeing the Wi-Fi.\\nWhat you don’t know can hurt you\\nOkay, we return to those ‘two worlds’ of human society and the Cult\\nwith its global network of interconnecting secret societies and\\nsatanic groups which manipulate through governments,\\ncorporations, media, religions, etc. The fundamental diﬀerence\\nbetween them is knowledge. The idea has been to keep humanity ignorant of the plan for its total enslavement underpinned by a\\ncrucial ignorance of reality – who we are and where we are – and\\nhow we interact with it. ‘Human’ should be the interaction between\\nour expanded eternal consciousness and the ﬁve-sense body\\nexperience. We are meant to be in this world in terms of the ﬁve\\nsenses but not of this world in relation to our greater consciousness\\nand perspective. In that state we experience the small picture of the\\nﬁve senses within the wider context of the big picture of awareness\\nbeyond the ﬁve senses. Put another way the ﬁve senses see the dots\\nand expanded awareness connects them into pictures and pa\\x00erns\\nthat give context to the apparently random and unconnected.\\nWithout the context of expanded awareness the ﬁve senses see only\\napartness and randomness with apparently no meaning. The Cult\\nand its other-dimensional controllers seek to intervene in the\\nfrequency realm where ﬁve-sense reality is supposed to connect with\\nexpanded reality and to keep the two apart (more on this in the ﬁnal\\nchapter). When that happens ﬁve-sense mental and emotional\\nprocesses are no longer inﬂuenced by expanded awareness, or the\\nTrue ‘I’, and instead are driven by the isolated perceptions of the\\nbody’s decoding systems. They are in the world and of it. Here we\\nhave the human plight and why humanity with its potential for\\ninﬁnite awareness can be so easily manipulatable and descend into\\nsuch extremes of stupidity.\\nOnce the Cult isolates ﬁve-sense mind from expanded awareness\\nit can then program the mind with perceptions and beliefs by\\ncontrolling information that the mind receives through the\\n‘education’ system of the formative years and the media perceptual\\nbombardment and censorship of an entire lifetime. Limit perception\\nand a sense of the possible through limiting knowledge by limiting\\nand skewing information while censoring and discrediting that\\nwhich could set people free. As the title of another of my books says\\n… And The Truth Shall Set You Free. For this reason the last thing the\\nCult wants in circulation is the truth about anything – especially the\\nreality of the eternal ‘I’ – and that’s why it is desperate to control\\ninformation. The Cult knows that information becomes perception which becomes behaviour which, collectively, becomes human\\nsociety. Cult-controlled and funded mainstream ‘science’ denies the\\nexistence of an eternal ‘I’ and seeks to dismiss and trash all evidence\\nto the contrary. Cult-controlled mainstream religion has a version of\\n‘God’ that is li\\x00le more than a system of control and dictatorship\\nthat employs threats of damnation in an a\\x00erlife to control\\nperceptions and behaviour in the here and now through fear and\\nguilt. Neither is true and it’s the ‘neither’ that the Cult wishes to\\nsuppress. This ‘neither’ is that everything is an expression, a point of\\na\\x00ention, within an inﬁnite state of consciousness which is the real\\nmeaning of the term ‘God’.\\nPerceptual obsession with the ‘physical body’ and ﬁve-senses\\nmeans that ‘God’ becomes personiﬁed as a bearded bloke si\\x00ing\\namong the clouds or a raging bully who loves us if we do what ‘he’\\nwants and condemns us to the ﬁres of hell if we don’t. These are no\\nmore than a ‘spiritual’ fairy tales to control and dictate events and\\nbehaviour through fear of this ‘God’ which has bizarrely made ‘God-\\nfearing’ in religious circles a state to be desired. I would suggest that\\nfearing anything is not to be encouraged and celebrated, but rather\\ndeleted. You can see why ‘God fearing’ is so beneﬁcial to the Cult\\nand its religions when they decide what ‘God’ wants and what ‘God’\\ndemands (the Cult demands) that everyone do. As the great\\nAmerican comedian Bill Hicks said satirising a Christian zealot: ‘I\\nthink what God meant to say.’ How much of this inﬁnite awareness\\n(‘God’) that we access is decided by how far we choose to expand\\nour perceptions, self-identity and sense of the possible. The scale of\\nself-identity reﬂects itself in the scale of awareness that we can\\nconnect with and are inﬂuenced by – how much knowing and\\ninsight we have instead of programmed perception. You cannot\\nexpand your awareness into the inﬁnity of possibility when you\\nbelieve that you are li\\x00le me Peter the postman or Mary in marketing\\nand nothing more. I’ll deal with this in the concluding chapter\\nbecause it’s crucial to how we turnaround current events.\\nWhere the Cult came from When I realised in the early 1990s there was a Cult network behind\\nglobal events I asked the obvious question: When did it start? I took\\nit back to ancient Rome and Egypt and on to Babylon and Sumer in\\nMesopotamia, the ‘Land Between Two Rivers’, in what we now call\\nIraq. The two rivers are the Tigris and Euphrates and this region is of\\nimmense historical and other importance to the Cult, as is the land\\ncalled Israel only 550 miles away by air. There is much more going\\nwith deep esoteric meaning across this whole region. It’s not only\\nabout ‘wars for oil’. Priceless artefacts from Mesopotamia were\\nstolen or destroyed a\\x00er the American and British invasion of Iraq in\\n2003 justiﬁed by the lies of Boy Bush and Tony Blair (their Cult\\nmasters) about non-existent ‘weapons of mass destruction’.\\nMesopotamia was the location of Sumer (about 5,400BC to 1,750BC),\\nand Babylon (about 2,350BC to 539BC). Sabbatians may have become\\nimmensely inﬂuential in the Cult in modern times but they are part\\nof a network that goes back into the mists of history. Sumer is said by\\nhistorians to be the ‘cradle of civilisation’. I disagree. I say it was the\\nre-start of what we call human civilisation a\\x00er cataclysmic events\\nsymbolised in part as the ‘Great Flood’ destroyed the world that\\nexisted before. These fantastic upheavals that I have been describing\\nin detail in the books since the early1990s appear in accounts and\\nlegends of ancient cultures across the world and they are supported\\nby geological and biological evidence. Stone tablets found in Iraq\\ndetailing the Sumer period say the cataclysms were caused by non-\\nhuman ‘gods’ they call the Anunnaki. These are described in terms\\nof extraterrestrial visitations in which knowledge supplied by the\\nAnunnaki is said to have been the source of at least one of the\\nworld’s oldest writing systems and developments in astronomy,\\nmathematics and architecture that were way ahead of their time. I\\nhave covered this subject at length in The Biggest Secret and Children\\nof the Matrix and the same basic ‘Anunnaki’ story can be found in\\nZulu accounts in South Africa where the late and very great Zulu\\nhigh shaman Credo Mutwa told me that the Sumerian Anunnaki\\nwere known by Zulus as the Chitauri or ‘children of the serpent’. See\\nmy six-hour video interview with Credo on this subject entitled The Reptilian Agenda recorded at his then home near Johannesburg in\\n1999 which you can watch on the Ickonic media platform.\\nThe Cult emerged out of Sumer, Babylon and Egypt (and\\nelsewhere) and established the Roman Empire before expanding\\nwith the Romans into northern Europe from where many empires\\nwere savagely imposed in the form of Cult-controlled societies all\\nover the world. Mass death and destruction was their calling card.\\nThe Cult established its centre of operations in Europe and European\\nEmpires were Cult empires which allowed it to expand into a global\\nforce. Spanish and Portuguese colonialists headed for Central and\\nSouth America while the British and French targeted North America.\\nAfrica was colonised by Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands,\\nPortugal, Spain, Italy, and Germany. Some like Britain and France\\nmoved in on the Middle East. The British Empire was by far the\\nbiggest for a simple reason. By now Britain was the headquarters of\\nthe Cult from which it expanded to form Canada, the United States,\\nAustralia and New Zealand. The Sun never set on the British Empire\\nsuch was the scale of its occupation. London remains a global centre\\nfor the Cult along with Rome and the Vatican although others have\\nemerged in Israel and China. It is no accident that the ‘virus’ is\\nalleged to have come out of China while Italy was chosen as the\\nmeans to terrify the Western population into compliance with\\n‘Covid’ fascism. Nor that Israel has led the world in ‘Covid’ fascism\\nand mass ‘vaccination’.\\nYou would think that I would mention the United States here, but\\nwhile it has been an important means of imposing the Cult’s will it is\\nless signiﬁcant than would appear and is currently in the process of\\nhaving what power it does have deleted. The Cult in Europe has\\nmostly loaded the guns for the US to ﬁre. America has been\\ncontrolled from Europe from the start through Cult operatives in\\nBritain and Europe. The American Revolution was an illusion to\\nmake it appear that America was governing itself while very\\ndiﬀerent forces were pulling the strings in the form of Cult families\\nsuch as the Rothschilds through the Rockefellers and other\\nsubordinates. The Rockefellers are extremely close to Bill Gates and established both scalpel and drug ‘medicine’ and the World Health\\nOrganization. They play a major role in the development and\\ncirculation of vaccines through the Rockefeller Foundation on which\\nBill Gates said his Foundation is based. Why wouldn’t this be the\\ncase when the Rockefellers and Gates are on the same team? Cult\\ninﬁltration of human society goes way back into what we call history\\nand has been constantly expanding and centralising power with the\\ngoal of establishing a global structure to dictate everything. Look\\nhow this has been advanced in great leaps with the ‘Covid’ hoax.\\nThe non-human dimension\\nI researched and observed the comings and goings of Cult operatives\\nthrough the centuries and even thousands of years as they were\\nborn, worked to promote the agenda within the secret society and\\nsatanic networks, and then died for others to replace them. Clearly\\nthere had to be a coordinating force that spanned this entire period\\nwhile operatives who would not have seen the end goal in their\\nlifetimes came and went advancing the plan over millennia. I went\\nin search of that coordinating force with the usual support from the\\nextraordinary synchronicity of my life which has been an almost\\ndaily experience since 1990. I saw common themes in religious texts\\nand ancient cultures about a non-human force manipulating human\\nsociety from the hidden. Christianity calls this force Satan, the Devil\\nand demons; Islam refers to the Jinn or Djinn; Zulus have their\\nChitauri (spelt in other ways in diﬀerent parts of Africa); and the\\nGnostic people in Egypt in the period around and before 400AD\\nreferred to this phenomena as the ‘Archons’, a word meaning rulers\\nin Greek. Central American cultures speak of the ‘Predators’ among\\nother names and the same theme is everywhere. I will use ‘Archons’\\nas a collective name for all of them. When you see how their nature\\nand behaviour is described all these diﬀerent sources are clearly\\ntalking about the same force. Gnostics described the Archons in\\nterms of ‘luminous ﬁre’ while Islam relates the Jinn to ‘smokeless\\nﬁre’. Some refer to beings in form that could occasionally be seen,\\nbut the most common of common theme is that they operate from unseen realms which means almost all existence to the visual\\nprocesses of humans. I had concluded that this was indeed the\\nfoundation of human control and that the Cult was operating within\\nthe human frequency band on behalf of this hidden force when I\\ncame across the writings of Gnostics which supported my\\nconclusions in the most extraordinary way.\\nA sealed earthen jar was found in 1945 near the town of Nag\\nHammadi about 75-80 miles north of Luxor on the banks of the River\\nNile in Egypt. Inside was a treasure trove of manuscripts and texts\\nle\\x00 by the Gnostic people some 1,600 years earlier. They included 13\\nleather-bound papyrus codices (manuscripts) and more than 50 texts\\nwri\\x00en in Coptic Egyptian estimated to have been hidden in the jar\\nin the period of 400AD although the source of the information goes\\nback much further. Gnostics oversaw the Great or Royal Library of\\nAlexandria, the fantastic depository of ancient texts detailing\\nadvanced knowledge and accounts of human history. The Library\\nwas dismantled and destroyed in stages over a long period with the\\ndeath-blow delivered by the Cult-established Roman Church in the\\nperiod around 415AD. The Church of Rome was the Church of\\nBabylon relocated as I said earlier. Gnostics were not a race. They\\nwere a way of perceiving reality. Whenever they established\\nthemselves and their information circulated the terrorists of the\\nChurch of Rome would target them for destruction. This happened\\nwith the Great Library and with the Gnostic Cathars who were\\nburned to death by the psychopaths a\\x00er a long period of\\noppression at the siege of the Castle of Monségur in southern France\\nin 1244. The Church has always been terriﬁed of Gnostic information\\nwhich demolishes the oﬃcial Christian narrative although there is\\nmuch in the Bible that supports the Gnostic view if you read it in\\nanother way. To anyone studying the texts of what became known as\\nthe Nag Hammadi Library it is clear that great swathes of Christian\\nand Biblical belief has its origin with Gnostics sources going back to\\nSumer. Gnostic themes have been twisted to manipulate the\\nperceived reality of Bible believers. Biblical texts have been in the\\nopen for centuries where they could be changed while Gnostic documents found at Nag Hammadi were sealed away and\\nuntouched for 1,600 years. What you see is what they wrote.\\nUse your pneuma not your nous\\nGnosticism and Gnostic come from ‘gnosis’ which means\\nknowledge, or rather secret knowledge, in the sense of spiritual\\nawareness – knowledge about reality and life itself. The desperation\\nof the Cult’s Church of Rome to destroy the Gnostics can be\\nunderstood when the knowledge they were circulating was the last\\nthing the Cult wanted the population to know. Sixteen hundred\\nyears later the same Cult is working hard to undermine and silence\\nme for the same reason. The dynamic between knowledge and\\nignorance is a constant. ‘Time’ appears to move on, but essential\\nthemes remain the same. We are told to ‘use your nous’, a Gnostic\\nword for head/brain/intelligence. They said, however, that spiritual\\nawakening or ‘salvation’ could only be secured by expanding\\nawareness beyond what they called nous and into pneuma or Inﬁnite\\nSelf. Obviously as I read these texts the parallels with what I have\\nbeen saying since 1990 were fascinating to me. There is a universal\\ntruth that spans human history and in that case why wouldn’t we be\\ntalking the same language 16 centuries apart? When you free\\nyourself from the perception program of the ﬁve senses and explore\\nexpanded realms of consciousness you are going to connect with the\\nsame information no ma\\x00er what the perceived ‘era’ within a\\nmanufactured timeline of a single and tiny range of manipulated\\nfrequency. Humans working with ‘smart’ technology or knocking\\nrocks together in caves is only a timeline appearing to operate within\\nthe human frequency band. Expanded awareness and the\\nknowledge it holds have always been there whether the era be Stone\\nAge or computer age. We can only access that knowledge by\\nopening ourselves to its frequency which the ﬁve-sense prison cell is\\ndesigned to stop us doing. Gates, Fauci, Whi\\x00y, Vallance,\\nZuckerberg, Brin, Page, Wojcicki, Bezos, and all the others behind\\nthe ‘Covid’ hoax clearly have a long wait before their range of\\nfrequency can make that connection given that an open heart is crucial to that as we shall see. Instead of accessing knowledge\\ndirectly through expanded awareness it is given to Cult operatives\\nby the secret society networks of the Cult where it has been passed\\non over thousands of years outside the public arena. Expanded\\nrealms of consciousness is where great artists, composers and\\nwriters ﬁnd their inspiration and where truth awaits anyone open\\nenough to connect with it. We need to go there fast.\\nArchon hijack\\nA ﬁ\\x00h of the Nag Hammadi texts describe the existence and\\nmanipulation of the Archons led by a ‘Chief Archon’ they call\\n‘Yaldabaoth’, or the ‘Demiurge’, and this is the Christian ‘Devil’,\\n‘Satan’, ‘Lucifer’, and his demons. Archons in Biblical symbolism are\\nthe ‘fallen ones’ which are also referred to as fallen angels a\\x00er the\\nangels expelled from heaven according to the Abrahamic religions of\\nJudaism, Christianity and Islam. These angels are claimed to tempt\\nhumans to ‘sin’ ongoing and you will see how accurate that\\nsymbolism is during the rest of the book. The theme of ‘original sin’\\nis related to the ‘Fall’ when Adam and Eve were ‘tempted by the\\nserpent’ and fell from a state of innocence and ‘obedience’\\n(connection) with God into a state of disobedience (disconnection).\\nThe Fall is said to have brought sin into the world and corrupted\\neverything including human nature. Yaldabaoth, the ‘Lord Archon’,\\nis described by Gnostics as a ‘counterfeit spirit’, ‘The Blind One’,\\n‘The Blind God’, and ‘The Foolish One’. The Jewish name for\\nYaldabaoth in Talmudic writings is Samael which translates as\\n‘Poison of God’, or ‘Blindness of God’. You see the parallels.\\nYaldabaoth in Islamic belief is the Muslim Jinn devil known as\\nShaytan – Shaytan is Satan as the same themes are found all over the\\nworld in every religion and culture. The ‘Lord God’ of the Old\\nTestament is the ‘Lord Archon’ of Gnostic manuscripts and that’s\\nwhy he’s such a bloodthirsty bastard. Satan is known by Christians\\nas ‘the Demon of Demons’ and Gnostics called Yaldabaoth the\\n‘Archon of Archons’. Both are known as ‘The Deceiver’. We are\\ntalking about the same ‘bloke’ for sure and these common themes using diﬀerent names, storylines and symbolism tell a common tale\\nof the human plight.\\nArchons are referred to in Nag Hammadi documents as mind\\nparasites, inverters, guards, gatekeepers, detainers, judges, pitiless\\nones and deceivers. The ‘Covid’ hoax alone is a glaring example of\\nall these things. The Biblical ‘God’ is so diﬀerent in the Old and New\\nTestaments because they are not describing the same phenomenon.\\nThe vindictive, angry, hate-ﬁlled, ‘God’ of the Old Testament, known\\nas Yahweh, is Yaldabaoth who is depicted in Cult-dictated popular\\nculture as the ‘Dark Lord’, ‘Lord of Time’, Lord (Darth) Vader and\\nDormammu, the evil ruler of the ‘Dark Dimension’ trying to take\\nover the ‘Earth Dimension’ in the Marvel comic movie, Dr Strange.\\nYaldabaoth is both the Old Testament ‘god’ and the Biblical ‘Satan’.\\nGnostics referred to Yaldabaoth as the ‘Great Architect of the\\nUniverse’and the Cult-controlled Freemason network calls their god\\n‘the ‘Great Architect of the Universe’ (also Grand Architect). The\\n‘Great Architect’ Yaldabaoth is symbolised by the Cult as the all-\\nseeing eye at the top of the pyramid on the Great Seal of the United\\nStates and the dollar bill. Archon is encoded in arch-itect as it is in\\narch-angels and arch-bishops. All religions have the theme of a force\\nfor good and force for evil in some sort of spiritual war and there is a\\nreason for that – the theme is true. The Cult and its non-human\\nmasters are quite happy for this to circulate. They present\\nthemselves as the force for good ﬁghting evil when they are really\\nthe force of evil (absence of love). The whole foundation of Cult\\nmodus operandi is inversion. They promote themselves as a force for\\ngood and anyone challenging them in pursuit of peace, love,\\nfairness, truth and justice is condemned as a satanic force for evil.\\nThis has been the game plan throughout history whether the Church\\nof Rome inquisitions of non-believers or ‘conspiracy theorists’ and\\n‘anti-vaxxers’ of today. The technique is the same whatever the\\ntimeline era.\\nYaldabaoth is revolting (true) Yaldabaoth and the Archons are said to have revolted against God\\nwith Yaldabaoth claiming to be God – the All That Is. The Old\\nTestament ‘God’ (Yaldabaoth) demanded to be worshipped as such: ‘\\nI am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me’\\n(Isaiah 45:5). I have quoted in other books a man who said he was\\nthe unoﬃcial son of the late Baron Philippe de Rothschild of the\\nMouton-Rothschild wine producing estates in France who died in\\n1988 and he told me about the Rothschild ‘revolt from God’. The\\nman said he was given the name Phillip Eugene de Rothschild and\\nwe shared long correspondence many years ago while he was living\\nunder another identity. He said that he was conceived through\\n‘occult incest’ which (within the Cult) was ‘normal and to be\\nadmired’. ‘Phillip’ told me about his experience a\\x00ending satanic\\nrituals with rich and famous people whom he names and you can\\nsee them and the wider background to Cult Satanism in my other\\nbooks starting with The Biggest Secret. Cult rituals are interactions\\nwith Archontic ‘gods’. ‘Phillip’ described Baron Philippe de\\nRothschild as ‘a master Satanist and hater of God’ and he used the\\nsame term ‘revolt from God’ associated with\\nYaldabaoth/Satan/Lucifer/the Devil in describing the Sabbatian\\nRothschild dynasty. ‘I played a key role in my family’s revolt from\\nGod’, he said. That role was to inﬁltrate in classic Sabbatian style the\\nChristian Church, but eventually he escaped the mind-prison to live\\nanother life. The Cult has been targeting religion in a plan to make\\nworship of the Archons the global one-world religion. Inﬁltration of\\nSatanism into modern ‘culture’, especially among the young,\\nthrough music videos, stage shows and other means, is all part of\\nthis.\\nNag Hammadi texts describe Yaldabaoth and the Archons in their\\nprime form as energy – consciousness – and say they can take form if\\nthey choose in the same way that consciousness takes form as a\\nhuman. Yaldabaoth is called ‘formless’ and represents a deeply\\ninverted, distorted and chaotic state of consciousness which seeks to\\na\\x00ached to humans and turn them into a likeness of itself in an\\na\\x00empt at assimilation. For that to happen it has to manipulate humans into low frequency mental and emotional states that match\\nits own. Archons can certainly appear in human form and this is the\\norigin of the psychopathic personality. The energetic distortion\\nGnostics called Yaldabaoth is psychopathy. When psychopathic\\nArchons take human form that human will be a psychopath as an\\nexpression of Yaldabaoth consciousness. Cult psychopaths are\\nArchons in human form. The principle is the same as that portrayed\\nin the 2009 Avatar movie when the American military travelled to a\\nﬁctional Earth-like moon called Pandora in the Alpha Centauri star\\nsystem to inﬁltrate a society of blue people, or Na’vi, by hiding\\nwithin bodies that looked like the Na’vi. Archons posing as humans\\nhave a particular hybrid information ﬁeld, part human, part Archon,\\n(the ancient ‘demigods’) which processes information in a way that\\nmanifests behaviour to match their psychopathic evil, lack of\\nempathy and compassion, and stops them being inﬂuenced by the\\nempathy, compassion and love that a fully-human information ﬁeld\\nis capable of expressing. Cult bloodlines interbreed, be they royalty\\nor dark suits, for this reason and you have their obsession with\\nincest. Interbreeding with full-blown humans would dilute the\\nArchontic energy ﬁeld that guarantees psychopathy in its\\nrepresentatives in the human realm.\\nGnostic writings say the main non-human forms that Archons\\ntake are serpentine (what I have called for decades ‘reptilian’ amid\\nunbounded ridicule from the Archontically-programmed) and what\\nGnostics describe as ‘an unborn baby or foetus with grey skin and\\ndark, unmoving eyes’. This is an excellent representation of the ET\\n‘Greys’ of UFO folklore which large numbers of people claim to have\\nseen and been abducted by – Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa among\\nthem. I agree with those that believe in extraterrestrial or\\ninterdimensional visitations today and for thousands of years past.\\nNo wonder with their advanced knowledge and technological\\ncapability they were perceived and worshipped as gods for\\ntechnological and other ‘miracles’ they appeared to perform.\\nImagine someone arriving in a culture disconnected from the\\nmodern world with a smartphone and computer. They would be seen as a ‘god’ capable of ‘miracles’. The Renegade Mind, however,\\nwants to know the source of everything and not only the way that\\nsource manifests as human or non-human. In the same way that a\\nRenegade Mind seeks the original source material for the ‘Covid\\nvirus’ to see if what is claimed is true. The original source of\\nArchons in form is consciousness – the distorted state of\\nconsciousness known to Gnostics as Yaldabaoth.\\n‘Revolt from God’ is energetic disconnection\\nWhere I am going next will make a lot of sense of religious texts and\\nancient legends relating to ‘Satan’, Lucifer’ and the ‘gods’. Gnostic\\ndescriptions sync perfectly with the themes of my own research over\\nthe years in how they describe a consciousness distortion seeking to\\nimpose itself on human consciousness. I’ve referred to the core of\\ninﬁnite awareness in previous books as Inﬁnite Awareness in\\nAwareness of Itself. By that I mean a level of awareness that knows\\nthat it is all awareness and is aware of all awareness. From here\\ncomes the frequency of love in its true sense and balance which is\\nwhat love is on one level – the balance of all forces into a single\\nwhole called Oneness and Isness. The more we disconnect from this\\nstate of love that many call ‘God’ the constituent parts of that\\nOneness start to unravel and express themselves as a part and not a\\nwhole. They become individualised as intellect, mind, selﬁshness,\\nhatred, envy, desire for power over others, and such like. This is not\\na problem in the greater scheme in that ‘God’, the All That Is, can\\nexperience all these possibilities through diﬀerent expressions of\\nitself including humans. What we as expressions of the whole\\nexperience the All That Is experiences. We are the All That Is\\nexperiencing itself. As we withdraw from that state of Oneness we\\ndisconnect from its inﬂuence and things can get very unpleasant and\\nvery stupid. Archontic consciousness is at the extreme end of that. It\\nhas so disconnected from the inﬂuence of Oneness that it has become\\nan inversion of unity and love, an inversion of everything, an\\ninversion of life itself. Evil is appropriately live wri\\x00en backwards.\\nArchontic consciousness is obsessed with death, an inversion of life, and so its manifestations in Satanism are obsessed with death. They\\nuse inverted symbols in their rituals such as the inverted pentagram\\nand cross. Sabbatians as Archontic consciousness incarnate invert\\nJudaism and every other religion and culture they inﬁltrate. They\\nseek disunity and chaos and they fear unity and harmony as they\\nfear love like garlic to a vampire. As a result the Cult, Archons\\nincarnate, act with such evil, psychopathy and lack of empathy and\\ncompassion disconnected as they are from the source of love. How\\ncould Bill Gates and the rest of the Archontic psychopaths do what\\nthey have to human society in the ‘Covid’ era with all the death,\\nsuﬀering and destruction involved and have no emotional\\nconsequence for the impact on others? Now you know. Why have\\nZuckerberg, Brin, Page, Wojcicki and company callously censored\\ninformation warning about the dangers of the ‘vaccine’ while\\nthousands have been dying and having severe, sometimes life-\\nchanging reactions? Now you know. Why have Tedros, Fauci,\\nWhi\\x00y, Vallance and their like around the world been using case and\\ndeath ﬁgures they’re aware are fraudulent to justify lockdowns and\\nall the deaths and destroyed lives that have come from that? Now\\nyou know. Why did Christian Drosten produce and promote a\\n‘testing’ protocol that he knew couldn’t test for infectious disease\\nwhich led to a global human catastrophe. Now you know. The\\nArchontic mind doesn’t give a shit (Fig 17). I personally think that\\nGates and major Cult insiders are a form of AI cyborg that the\\nArchons want humans to become. Figure 17: Artist Neil Hague’s version of the ‘Covid’ hierarchy.\\nHuman batteries\\nA state of such inversion does have its consequences, however. The\\nlevel of disconnection from the Source of All means that you\\nwithdraw from that source of energetic sustenance and creativity.\\nThis means that you have to ﬁnd your own supply of energetic\\npower and it has – us. When the Morpheus character in the ﬁrst\\nMatrix movie held up a ba\\x00ery he spoke a profound truth when he\\nsaid: ‘The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world built to keep\\nus under control in order to change the human being into one of these.’ The statement was true in all respects. We do live in a\\ntechnologically-generated virtual reality simulation (more very\\nshortly) and we have been manipulated to be an energy source for\\nArchontic consciousness. The Disney-Pixar animated movie\\nMonsters, Inc. in 2001 symbolised the dynamic when monsters in\\ntheir world had no energy source and they would enter the human\\nworld to terrify children in their beds, catch the child’s scream, terror\\n(low-vibrational frequencies), and take that energy back to power\\nthe monster world. The lead character you might remember was a\\nsingle giant eye and the symbolism of the Cult’s all-seeing eye was\\nobvious. Every thought and emotion is broadcast as a frequency\\nunique to that thought and emotion. Feelings of love and joy,\\nempathy and compassion, are high, quick, frequencies while fear,\\ndepression, anxiety, suﬀering and hate are low, slow, dense\\nfrequencies. Which kind do you think Archontic consciousness can\\nconnect with and absorb? In such a low and dense frequency state\\nthere’s no way it can connect with the energy of love and joy.\\nArchons can only feed oﬀ energy compatible with their own\\nfrequency and they and their Cult agents want to delete the human\\nworld of love and joy and manipulate the transmission of low\\nvibrational frequencies through low-vibrational human mental and\\nemotional states. We are their energy source. Wars are energetic\\nbanquets to the Archons – a world war even more so – and think\\nhow much low-frequency mental and emotional energy has been\\ngenerated from the consequences for humanity of the ‘Covid’ hoax\\norchestrated by Archons incarnate like Gates.\\nThe ancient practice of human sacriﬁce ‘to the gods’, continued in\\nsecret today by the Cult, is based on the same principle. ‘The gods’\\nare Archontic consciousness in diﬀerent forms and the sacriﬁce is\\ninduced into a state of intense terror to generate the energy the\\nArchontic frequency can absorb. Incarnate Archons in the ritual\\ndrink the blood which contains an adrenaline they crave which\\nﬂoods into the bloodstream when people are terrorised. Most of the\\nsacriﬁces, ancient and modern, are children and the theme of\\n‘sacriﬁcing young virgins to the gods’ is just code for children. They have a particular pre-puberty energy that Archons want more than\\nanything and the energy of the young in general is their target. The\\nCalifornia Department of Education wants students to chant the\\nnames of Aztec gods (Archontic gods) once worshipped in human\\nsacriﬁce rituals in a curriculum designed to encourage them to\\n‘challenge racist, bigoted, discriminatory, imperialist/colonial\\nbeliefs’, join ‘social movements that struggle for social justice’, and\\n‘build new possibilities for a post-racist, post-systemic racism\\nsociety’. It’s the usual Woke crap that inverts racism and calls it anti-\\nracism. In this case solidarity with ‘indigenous tribes’ is being used\\nas an excuse to chant the names of ‘gods’ to which people were\\nsacriﬁced (and still are in secret). What an example of Woke’s\\ninability to see beyond black and white, us and them, They condemn\\nthe colonisation of these tribal cultures by Europeans (quite right),\\nbut those cultures sacriﬁcing people including children to their\\n‘gods’, and mass murdering untold numbers as the Aztecs did, is\\njust ﬁne. One chant is to the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca who had a man\\nsacriﬁced to him in the 5th month of the Aztec calendar. His heart\\nwas cut out and he was eaten. Oh, that’s okay then. Come on\\nchildren … a\\x00er three … Other sacriﬁcial ‘gods’ for the young to\\nchant their allegiance include Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli and Xipe\\nTotec. The curriculum says that ‘chants, aﬃrmations, and energizers\\ncan be used to bring the class together, build unity around ethnic\\nstudies principles and values, and to reinvigorate the class following\\na lesson that may be emotionally taxing or even when student\\nengagement may appear to be low’. Well, that’s the cover story,\\nanyway. Chanting and mantras are the repetition of a particular\\nfrequency generated from the vocal cords and chanting the names of\\nthese Archontic ‘gods’ tunes you into their frequency. That is the last\\nthing you want when it allows for energetic synchronisation,\\na\\x00achment and perceptual inﬂuence. Initiates chant the names of\\ntheir ‘Gods’ in their rituals for this very reason.\\nVampires of the Woke Paedophilia is another way that Archons absorb the energy of\\nchildren. Paedophiles possessed by Archontic consciousness are\\nused as the conduit during sexual abuse for discarnate Archons to\\nvampire the energy of the young they desire so much. Stupendous\\nnumbers of children disappear every year never to be seen again\\nalthough you would never know from the media. Imagine how\\nmuch low-vibrational energy has been generated by children during\\nthe ‘Covid’ hoax when so many have become depressed and\\npsychologically destroyed to the point of killing themselves.\\nShocking numbers of children are now taken by the state from\\nloving parents to be handed to others. I can tell you from long\\nexperience of researching this since 1996 that many end up with\\npaedophiles and assets of the Cult through corrupt and Cult-owned\\nsocial services which in the reframing era has hired many\\npsychopaths and emotionless automatons to do the job. Children are\\neven stolen to order using spurious reasons to take them by the\\ncorrupt and secret (because they’re corrupt) ‘family courts’. I have\\nwri\\x00en in detail in other books, starting with The Biggest Secret in\\n1997, about the ubiquitous connections between the political,\\ncorporate, government, intelligence and military elites (Cult\\noperatives) and Satanism and paedophilia. If you go deep enough\\nboth networks have an interlocking leadership. The Woke mentality\\nhas been developed by the Cult for many reasons: To promote\\nalmost every aspect of its agenda; to hĳack the traditional political\\nle\\x00 and turn it fascist; to divide and rule; and to target agenda\\npushbackers. But there are other reasons which relate to what I am\\ndescribing here. How many happy and joyful Wokers do you ever\\nsee especially at the extreme end? They are a mental and\\npsychological mess consumed by emotional stress and constantly\\nemotionally cocked for the next explosion of indignation at someone\\nreferring to a female as a female. They are walking, talking, ba\\x00eries\\nas Morpheus might say emi\\x00ing frequencies which both enslave\\nthem in low-vibrational bubbles of perceptual limitation and feed\\nthe Archons. Add to this the hatred claimed to be love; fascism\\nclaimed to ‘anti-fascism’, racism claimed to be ‘anti-racism’; exclusion claimed to inclusion; and the abuse-ﬁlled Internet trolling.\\nYou have a purpose-built Archontic energy system with not a wind\\nturbine in sight and all founded on Archontic inversion. We have\\nwhole generations now manipulated to serve the Archons with their\\nactions and energy. They will be doing so their entire adult lives\\nunless they snap out of their Archon-induced trance. Is it really a\\nsurprise that Cult billionaires and corporations put so much money\\ntheir way? Where is the energy of joy and laughter, including\\nlaughing at yourself which is conﬁrmation of your own emotional\\nsecurity? Mark Twain said: ‘The human race has one really eﬀective\\nweapon, and that is laughter.‘ We must use it all the time. Woke has\\ndestroyed comedy because it has no humour, no joy, sense of irony,\\nor self-deprecation. Its energy is dense and intense. Mmmmm, lunch\\nsays the Archontic frequency. Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) was the\\nAustrian philosopher and famous esoteric thinker who established\\nWaldorf education or Steiner schools to treat children like unique\\nexpressions of consciousness and not minds to be programmed with\\nthe perceptions determined by authority. I’d been writing about this\\nenergy vampiring for decades when I was sent in 2016 a quote by\\nSteiner. He was spot on:\\nThere are beings in the spiritual realms for whom anxiety and fear emanating from human\\nbeings offer welcome food. When humans have no anxiety and fear, then these creatures\\nstarve. If fear and anxiety radiates from people and they break out in panic, then these\\ncreatures find welcome nutrition and they become more and more powerful. These beings are\\nhostile towards humanity. Everything that feeds on negative feelings, on anxiety, fear and\\nsuperstition, despair or doubt, are in reality hostile forces in super-sensible worlds, launching\\ncruel attacks on human beings, while they are being fed ... These are exactly the feelings that\\nbelong to contemporary culture and materialism; because it estranges people from the\\nspiritual world, it is especially suited to evoke hopelessness and fear of the unknown in\\npeople, thereby calling up the above mentioned hostile forces against them.\\nPause for a moment from this perspective and reﬂect on what has\\nhappened in the world since the start of 2020. Not only will pennies\\ndrop, but billion dollar bills. We see the same theme from Don Juan\\nMatus, a Yaqui Indian shaman in Mexico and the information source\\nfor Peruvian-born writer, Carlos Castaneda, who wrote a series of books from the 1960s to 1990s. Don Juan described the force\\nmanipulating human society and his name for the Archons was the\\npredator:\\nWe have a predator that came from the depths of the cosmos and took over the rule of our\\nlives. Human beings are its prisoners. The predator is our lord and master. It has rendered us\\ndocile, helpless. If we want to protest, it suppresses our protest. If we want to act\\nindependently, it demands that we don’t do so ... indeed we are held prisoner!\\nThey took us over because we are food to them, and they squeeze us mercilessly because we\\nare their sustenance. Just as we rear chickens in coops, the predators rear us in human coops,\\nhumaneros. Therefore, their food is always available to them.\\nDifferent cultures, different eras, same recurring theme.\\nThe ‘ennoia’ dilemma\\nNag Hammadi Gnostic manuscripts say that Archon consciousness\\nhas no ‘ennoia’. This is directly translated as ‘intentionality’, but I’ll\\nuse the term ‘creative imagination’. The All That Is in awareness of\\nitself is the source of all creativity – all possibility – and the more\\ndisconnected you are from that source the more you are\\nsubsequently denied ‘creative imagination’. Given that Archon\\nconsciousness is almost entirely disconnected it severely lacks\\ncreativity and has to rely on far more mechanical processes of\\nthought and exploit the creative potential of those that do have\\n‘ennoia’. You can see cases of this throughout human society. Archon\\nconsciousness almost entirely dominates the global banking system\\nand if we study how that system works you will appreciate what I\\nmean. Banks manifest ‘money’ out of nothing by issuing lines of\\n‘credit’ which is ‘money’ that has never, does not, and will never\\nexist except in theory. It’s a conﬁdence trick. If you think ‘credit’\\nﬁgures-on-a-screen ‘money’ is worth anything you accept it as\\npayment. If you don’t then the whole system collapses through lack\\nof conﬁdence in the value of that ‘money’. Archontic bankers with\\nno ‘ennoia’ are ‘lending’ ‘money’ that doesn’t exist to humans that do\\nhave creativity – those that have the inspired ideas and create\\nbusinesses and products. Archon banking feeds oﬀ human creativity which it controls through ‘money’ creation and debt. Humans have\\nthe creativity and Archons exploit that for their own beneﬁt and\\ncontrol while having none themselves. Archon Internet platforms\\nlike Facebook claim joint copyright of everything that creative users\\npost and while Archontic minds like Zuckerberg may oﬃcially head\\nthat company it will be human creatives on the staﬀ that provide the\\ncreative inspiration. When you have limitless ‘money’ you can then\\nbuy other companies established by creative humans. Witness the\\nacquisition record of Facebook, Google and their like. Survey the\\nArchon-controlled music industry and you see non-creative dark\\nsuit executives making their fortune from the human creativity of\\ntheir artists. The cases are endless. Research the history of people\\nlike Gates and Zuckerberg and how their empires were built on\\nexploiting the creativity of others. Archon minds cannot create out of\\nnothing, but they are skilled (because they have to be) in what\\nGnostic texts call ‘countermimicry’. They can imitate, but not\\ninnovate. Sabbatians trawl the creativity of others through\\nbackdoors they install in computer systems through their\\ncybersecurity systems. Archon-controlled China is globally infamous\\nfor stealing intellectual property and I remember how Hong Kong,\\nnow part of China, became notorious for making counterfeit copies\\nof the creativity of others – ‘countermimicry’. With the now\\npervasive and all-seeing surveillance systems able to inﬁltrate any\\ncomputer you can appreciate the potential for Archons to vampire\\nthe creativity of humans. Author John Lamb Lash wrote in his book\\nabout the Nag Hammadi texts, Not In His Image:\\nAlthough they cannot originate anything, because they lack the divine factor of ennoia\\n(intentionality), Archons can imitate with a vengeance. Their expertise is simulation (HAL,\\nvirtual reality). The Demiurge [Yaldabaoth] fashions a heaven world copied from the fractal\\npatterns [of the original] ... His construction is celestial kitsch, like the fake Italianate villa of a\\nMafia don complete with militant angels to guard every portal.\\nThis brings us to something that I have been speaking about since\\nthe turn of the millennium. Our reality is a simulation; a virtual\\nreality that we think is real. No, I’m not kidding. Human reality? Well, virtually\\nI had pondered for years about whether our reality is ‘real’ or some\\nkind of construct. I remembered being immensely aﬀected on a visit\\nas a small child in the late 1950s to the then newly-opened\\nPlanetarium on the Marylebone Road in London which is now\\nclosed and part of the adjacent Madame Tussauds wax museum. It\\nwas in the middle of the day, but when the lights went out there was\\nthe night sky projected in the Planetarium’s domed ceiling and it\\nappeared to be so real. The experience never le\\x00 me and I didn’t\\nknow why until around the turn of the millennium when I became\\ncertain that our ‘night sky’ and entire reality is a projection, a virtual\\nreality, akin to the illusory world portrayed in the Matrix movies. I\\nlooked at the sky one day in this period and it appeared to me like\\nthe domed roof of the Planetarium. The release of the ﬁrst Matrix\\nmovie in 1999 also provided a synchronistic and perfect visual\\nrepresentation of where my mind had been going for a long time. I\\nhadn’t come across the Gnostic Nag Hammadi texts then. When I\\ndid years later the correlation was once again astounding. As I read\\nGnostic accounts from 1,600 years and more earlier it was clear that\\nthey were describing the same simulation phenomenon. They tell\\nhow the Yaldabaoth ‘Demiurge’ and Archons created a ‘bad copy’ of\\noriginal reality to rule over all that were captured by its illusions and\\nthe body was a prison to trap consciousness in the ‘bad copy’ fake\\nreality. Read how Gnostics describe the ‘bad copy’ and update that\\nto current times and they are referring to what we would call today a\\nvirtual reality simulation.\\nAuthor John Lamb Lash said ‘the Demiurge fashions a heaven\\nworld copied from the fractal pa\\x00erns’ of the original through\\nexpertise in ‘HAL’ or virtual reality simulation. Fractal pa\\x00erns are\\npart of the energetic information construct of our reality, a sort of\\nblueprint. If these pa\\x00erns were copied in computer terms it would\\nindeed give you a copy of a ‘natural’ reality in a non-natural\\nfrequency and digital form. The principle is the same as making a\\ncopy of a website. The original website still exists, but now you can\\nchange the copy version to make it whatever you like and it can become very diﬀerent to the original website. Archons have done\\nthis with our reality, a synthetic copy of prime reality that still exists\\nbeyond the frequency walls of the simulation. Trapped within the\\nillusions of this synthetic Matrix, however, were and are human\\nconsciousness and other expressions of prime reality and this is why\\nthe Archons via the Cult are seeking to make the human body\\nsynthetic and give us synthetic AI minds to complete the job of\\nturning the entire reality synthetic including what we perceive to be\\nthe natural world. To quote Kurzweil: ‘Nanobots will infuse all the\\nma\\x00er around us with information. Rocks, trees, everything will\\nbecome these intelligent creatures.’ Yes, synthetic ‘creatures’ just as\\n‘Covid’ and other genetically-manipulating ‘vaccines’ are designed\\nto make the human body synthetic. From this perspective it is\\nobvious why Archons and their Cult are so desperate to infuse\\nsynthetic material into every human with their ‘Covid’ scam.\\nLet there be (electromagnetic) light\\nYaldabaoth, the force that created the simulation, or Matrix, makes\\nsense of the Gnostic reference to ‘The Great Architect’ and its use by\\nCult Freemasonry as the name of its deity. The designer of the Matrix\\nin the movies is called ‘The Architect’ and that trilogy is jam-packed\\nwith symbolism relating to these subjects. I have contended for years\\nthat the angry Old Testament God (Yaldabaoth) is the ‘God’ being\\nsymbolically ‘quoted’ in the opening of Genesis as ‘creating the\\nworld’. This is not the creation of prime reality – it’s the creation of\\nthe simulation. The Genesis ‘God’ says: ‘Let there be Light: and there\\nwas light.’ But what is this ‘Light’? I have said for decades that the\\nspeed of light (186,000 miles per second) is not the fastest speed\\npossible as claimed by mainstream science and is in fact the\\nfrequency walls or outer limits of the Matrix. You can’t have a fastest\\nor slowest anything within all possibility when everything is\\npossible. The human body is encoded to operate within the speed of\\nlight or within the simulation and thus we see only the tiny frequency\\nband of visible light. Near-death experiencers who perceive reality\\noutside the body during temporary ‘death’ describe a very diﬀerent form of light and this is supported by the Nag Hammadi texts.\\nPrime reality beyond the simulation (‘Upper Aeons’ to the Gnostics)\\nis described as a realm of incredible beauty, bliss, love and harmony\\n– a realm of ‘watery light’ that is so powerful ‘there are no shadows’.\\nOur false reality of Archon control, which Gnostics call the ‘Lower\\nAeons’, is depicted as a realm with a diﬀerent kind of ‘light’ and\\ndescribed in terms of chaos, ‘Hell’, ‘the Abyss’ and ‘Outer Darkness’,\\nwhere trapped souls are tormented and manipulated by demons\\n(relate that to the ‘Covid’ hoax alone). The watery light theme can be\\nfound in near-death accounts and it is not the same as simulation\\n‘light’ which is electromagnetic or radiation light within the speed of\\nlight – the ‘Lower Aeons’. Simulation ‘light’ is the ‘luminous ﬁre’\\nassociated by Gnostics with the Archons. The Bible refers to\\nYaldabaoth as ‘that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which\\ndeceiveth the whole world’ (Revelation 12:9). I think that making a\\nsimulated copy of prime reality (‘countermimicry’) and changing it\\ndramatically while all the time manipulating humanity to believe it\\nto be real could probably meet the criteria of deceiving the whole\\nworld. Then we come to the Cult god Lucifer – the Light Bringer.\\nLucifer is symbolic of Yaldabaoth, the bringer of radiation light that\\nforms the bad copy simulation within the speed of light. ‘He’ is\\nsymbolised by the lighted torch held by the Statue of Liberty and in\\nthe name ‘Illuminati’. Sabbatian-Frankism declares that Lucifer is the\\ntrue god and Lucifer is the real god of Freemasonry honoured as\\ntheir ‘Great or Grand Architect of the Universe’ (simulation).\\nI would emphasise, too, the way Archontic technologically-\\ngenerated luminous ﬁre of radiation has deluged our environment\\nsince I was a kid in the 1950s and changed the nature of The Field\\nwith which we constantly interact. Through that interaction\\ntechnological radiation is changing us. The Smart Grid is designed to\\noperate with immense levels of communication power with 5G\\nexpanding across the world and 6G, 7G, in the process of\\ndevelopment. Radiation is the simulation and the Archontic\\nmanipulation system. Why wouldn’t the Archon Cult wish to\\nunleash radiation upon us to an ever-greater extreme to form Kurzweil’s ‘cloud’? The plan for a synthetic human is related to the\\nneed to cope with levels of radiation beyond even anything we’ve\\nseen so far. Biological humans would not survive the scale of\\nradiation they have in their script. The Smart Grid is a technological\\nsub-reality within the technological simulation to further disconnect\\nﬁve-sense perception from expanded consciousness. It’s a\\ntechnological prison of the mind.\\nInfusing the ‘spirit of darkness’\\nA recurring theme in religion and native cultures is the\\nmanipulation of human genetics by a non-human force and most\\nfamously recorded as the biblical ‘sons of god’ (the gods plural in the\\noriginal) who interbred with the daughters of men. The Nag\\nHammadi Apocryphon of John tells the same story this way:\\nHe [Yaldabaoth] sent his angels [Archons/demons] to the daughters of men, that they might\\ntake some of them for themselves and raise offspring for their enjoyment. And at first they did\\nnot succeed. When they had no success, they gathered together again and they made a plan\\ntogether ... And the angels changed themselves in their likeness into the likeness of their\\nmates, filling them with the spirit of darkness, which they had mixed for them, and with evil ...\\nAnd they took women and begot children out of the darkness according to the likeness of\\ntheir spirit.\\nPossession when a discarnate entity takes over a human body is an\\nage-old theme and continues today. It’s very real and I’ve seen it.\\nSatanic and secret society rituals can create an energetic environment\\nin which entities can a\\x00ach to initiates and I’ve heard many stories\\nof how people have changed their personality a\\x00er being initiated\\neven into lower levels of the Freemasons. I have been inside three\\nFreemasonic temples, one at a public open day and two by just\\nwalking in when there was no one around to stop me. They were in\\nRyde, the town where I live, Birmingham, England, when I was with\\na group, and Boston, Massachuse\\x00s. They all felt the same\\nenergetically – dark, dense, low-vibrational and sinister. Demonic\\na\\x00achment can happen while the initiate has no idea what is going\\non. To them it’s just a ritual to get in the Masons and do a bit of good business. In the far more extreme rituals of Satanism human\\npossession is even more powerful and they are designed to make\\npossession possible. The hierarchy of the Cult is dictated by the\\npower and perceived status of the possessing Archon. In this way\\nthe Archon hierarchy becomes the Cult hierarchy. Once the entity\\nhas a\\x00ached it can inﬂuence perception and behaviour and if it\\na\\x00aches to the extreme then so much of its energy (information)\\ninfuses into the body information ﬁeld that the hologram starts to\\nreﬂect the nature of the possessing entity. This is the Exorcist movie\\ntype of possession when facial features change and it’s known as\\nshapeshi\\x00ing. Islam’s Jinn are said to be invisible tricksters who\\nchange shape, ‘whisper’, confuse and take human form. These are all\\ntraits of the Archons and other versions of the same phenomenon.\\nExtreme possession could certainty infuse the ‘spirit of darkness’\\ninto a partner during sex as the Nag Hammadi texts appear to\\ndescribe. Such an infusion can change genetics which is also\\nenergetic information. Human genetics is information and the ‘spirit\\nof darkness’ is information. Mix one with the other and change must\\nhappen. Islam has the concept of a ‘Jinn baby’ through possession of\\nthe mother and by Jinn taking human form. There are many ways\\nthat human genetics can be changed and remember that Archons\\nhave been aware all along of advanced techniques to do this. What is\\nbeing done in human society today – and far more – was known\\nabout by Archons at the time of the ‘fallen ones’ and their other\\nversions described in religions and cultures.\\nArchons and their human-world Cult are obsessed with genetics\\nas we see today and they know this dictates how information is\\nprocessed into perceived reality during a human life. They needed to\\nproduce a human form that would decode the simulation and this is\\nsymbolically known as ‘Adam and Eve’ who le\\x00 the ‘garden’ (prime\\nreality) and ‘fell’ into Matrix reality. The simulation is not a\\n‘physical’ construct (there is no ‘physical’); it is a source of\\ninformation. Think Wi-Fi again. The simulation is an energetic ﬁeld\\nencoded with information and body-brain systems are designed to\\ndecode that information encoded in wave or frequency form which is transmi\\x00ed to the brain as electrical signals. These are decoded by\\nthe brain to construct our sense of reality – an illusory ‘physical’\\nworld that only exists in the brain or the mind. Virtual reality games\\nmimic this process using the same sensory decoding system.\\nInformation is fed to the senses to decode a virtual reality that can\\nappear so real, but isn’t (Figs 18 and 19). Some scientists believe –\\nand I agree with them – that what we perceive as ‘physical’ reality\\nonly exists when we are looking or observing. The act of perception\\nor focus triggers the decoding systems which turn waveform\\ninformation into holographic reality. When we are not observing\\nsomething our reality reverts from a holographic state to a waveform\\nstate. This relates to the same principle as a falling tree not making a\\nnoise unless someone is there to hear it or decode it. The concept\\nmakes sense from the simulation perspective. A computer is not\\ndecoding all the information in a Wi-Fi ﬁeld all the time and only\\ndecodes or brings into reality on the screen that part of Wi-Fi that it’s\\ndecoding – focusing upon – at that moment.\\nFigure 18: Virtual reality technology ‘hacks’ into the body’s five-sense decoding system.\\nFigure 19: The result can be experienced as very ‘real’. Interestingly, Professor Donald Hoﬀman at the Department of\\nCognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, says that\\nour experienced reality is like a computer interface that shows us\\nonly the level with which we interact while hiding all that exists\\nbeyond it: ‘Evolution shaped us with a user interface that hides the\\ntruth. Nothing that we see is the truth – the very language of space\\nand time and objects is the wrong language to describe reality.’ He is\\ncorrect in what he says on so many levels. Space and time are not a\\nuniversal reality. They are a phenomenon of decoded simulation\\nreality as part of the process of enslaving our sense of reality. Near-\\ndeath experiencers report again and again how space and time did\\nnot exist as we perceive them once they were free of the body – body\\ndecoding systems. You can appreciate from this why Archons and\\ntheir Cult are so desperate to entrap human a\\x00ention in the ﬁve\\nsenses where we are in the Matrix and of the Matrix. Opening your\\nmind to expanded states of awareness takes you beyond the\\ninformation conﬁnes of the simulation and you become aware of\\nknowledge and insights denied to you before. This is what we call\\n‘awakening’ – awakening from the Matrix – and in the ﬁnal chapter I\\nwill relate this to current events.\\nWhere are the ‘aliens’?\\nA simulation would explain the so-called ‘Fermi Paradox’ named\\na\\x00er Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901-1954) who created the ﬁrst\\nnuclear reactor. He considered the question of why there is such a\\nlack of extraterrestrial activity when there are so many stars and\\nplanets in an apparently vast universe; but what if the night sky that\\nwe see, or think we do, is a simulated projection as I say? If you\\ncontrol the simulation and your aim is to hold humanity fast in\\nessential ignorance would you want other forms of life including\\nadvanced life coming and going sharing information with\\nhumanity? Or would you want them to believe they were isolated\\nand apparently alone? Themes of human isolation and apartness are\\ncommon whether they be the perception of a lifeless universe or the\\nfascist isolation laws of the ‘Covid’ era. Paradoxically the very existence of a simulation means that we are not alone when some\\nforce had to construct it. My view is that experiences that people\\nhave reported all over the world for centuries with Reptilians and\\nGrey entities are Archon phenomena as Nag Hammadi texts\\ndescribe; and that benevolent ‘alien’ interactions are non-human\\ngroups that come in and out of the simulation by overcoming\\nArchon a\\x00empts to keep them out. It should be highlighted, too, that\\nReptilians and Greys are obsessed with genetics and technology as\\nrelated by cultural accounts and those who say they have been\\nabducted by them. Technology is their way of overcoming some of\\nthe limitations in their creative potential and our technology-driven\\nand controlled human society of today is archetypical Archon-\\nReptilian-Grey modus operandi. Technocracy is really Archontocracy.\\nThe Universe does not have to be as big as it appears with a\\nsimulation. There is no space or distance only information decoded\\ninto holographic reality. What we call ‘space’ is only the absence of\\nholographic ‘objects’ and that ‘space’ is The Field of energetic\\ninformation which connects everything into a single whole. The\\nsame applies with the artiﬁcially-generated information ﬁeld of the\\nsimulation. The Universe is not big or small as a physical reality. It is\\ndecoded information, that’s all, and its perceived size is decided by\\nthe way the simulation is encoded to make it appear. The entire\\nnight sky as we perceive it only exists in our brain and so where are\\nthose ‘millions of light years’? The ‘stars’ on the ceiling of the\\nPlanetarium looked a vast distance away.\\nThere’s another point to mention about ‘aliens’. I have been\\nhighlighting since the 1990s the plan to stage a fake ‘alien invasion’\\nto justify the centralisation of global power and a world military.\\nNazi scientist Werner von Braun, who was taken to America by\\nOperation Paperclip a\\x00er World War Two to help found NASA, told\\nhis American assistant Dr Carol Rosin about the Cult agenda when\\nhe knew he was dying in 1977. Rosin said that he told her about a\\nsequence that would lead to total human control by a one-world\\ngovernment. This included threats from terrorism, rogue nations,\\nmeteors and asteroids before ﬁnally an ‘alien invasion’. All of these things, von Braun said, would be bogus and what I would refer to as\\na No-Problem-Reaction-Solution. Keep this in mind when ‘the aliens\\nare coming’ is the new mantra. The aliens are not coming – they are\\nalready here and they have inﬁltrated human society while looking\\nhuman. French-Canadian investigative journalist Serge Monast said\\nin 1994 that he had uncovered a NASA/military operation called\\nProject Blue Beam which ﬁts with what Werner von Braun predicted.\\nMonast died of a ‘heart a\\x00ack’ in 1996 the day a\\x00er he was arrested\\nand spent a night in prison. He was 51. He said Blue Beam was a\\nplan to stage an alien invasion that would include religious ﬁgures\\nbeamed holographically into the sky as part of a global manipulation\\nto usher in a ‘new age’ of worshipping what I would say is the Cult\\n‘god’ Yaldabaoth in a one-world religion. Fake holographic asteroids\\nare also said to be part of the plan which again syncs with von\\nBraun. How could you stage an illusory threat from asteroids unless\\nthey were holographic inserts? This is pre\\x00y straightforward given\\nthe advanced technology outside the public arena and the fact that\\nour ‘physical’ reality is holographic anyway. Information ﬁelds\\nwould be projected and we would decode them into the illusion of a\\n‘physical’ asteroid. If they can sell a global ‘pandemic’ with a ‘virus’\\nthat doesn’t exist what will humans not believe if government and\\nmedia tell them?\\nAll this is particularly relevant as I write with the Pentagon\\nplanning to release in June, 2021, information about ‘UFO sightings’.\\nI have been following the UFO story since the early 1990s and the\\ncommon theme throughout has been government and military\\ndenials and cover up. More recently, however, the Pentagon has\\nsuddenly become more talkative and apparently open with Air\\nForce pilot radar images released of unexplained cra\\x00 moving and\\nchanging direction at speeds well beyond anything believed possible\\nwith human technology. Then, in March, 2021, former Director of\\nNational Intelligence John Ratcliﬀe said a Pentagon report months\\nlater in June would reveal a great deal of information about UFO\\nsightings unknown to the public. He said the report would have\\n‘massive implications’. The order to do this was included bizarrely in a $2.3 trillion ‘coronavirus’ relief and government funding bill\\npassed by the Trump administration at the end of 2020. I would add\\nsome serious notes of caution here. I have been pointing out since\\nthe 1990s that the US military and intelligence networks have long\\nhad cra\\x00 – ‘ﬂying saucers’ or anti-gravity cra\\x00 – which any observer\\nwould take to be extraterrestrial in origin. Keeping this knowledge\\nfrom the public allows cra\\x00 ﬂown by humans to be perceived as alien\\nvisitations. I am not saying that ‘aliens’ do not exist. I would be the\\nlast one to say that, but we have to be streetwise here. President\\nRonald Reagan told the UN General Assembly in 1987: ‘I\\noccasionally think how quickly our diﬀerences worldwide would\\nvanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.’\\nThat’s the idea. Unite against a common ‘enemy’ with a common\\npurpose behind your ‘saviour force’ (the Cult) as this age-old\\ntechnique of mass manipulation goes global.\\nScience moves this way …\\nI could ﬁnd only one other person who was discussing the\\nsimulation hypothesis publicly when I concluded it was real. This\\nwas Nick Bostrom, a Swedish-born philosopher at the University of\\nOxford, who has explored for many years the possibility that human\\nreality is a computer simulation although his version and mine are\\nnot the same. Today the simulation and holographic reality\\nhypothesis have increasingly entered the scientiﬁc mainstream. Well,\\nthe more open-minded mainstream, that is. Here are a few of the\\never-gathering examples. American nuclear physicist Silas Beane led\\na team of physicists at the University of Bonn in Germany pursuing\\nthe question of whether we live in a simulation. They concluded that\\nwe probably do and it was likely based on a la\\x00ice of cubes. They\\nfound that cosmic rays align with that speciﬁc pa\\x00ern. The team\\nhighlighted the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit which refers\\nto cosmic ray particle interaction with cosmic background radiation\\nthat creates an apparent boundary for cosmic ray particles. They say\\nin a paper entitled ‘Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical\\nSimulation’ that this ‘pa\\x00ern of constraint’ is exactly what you would ﬁnd with a computer simulation. They also made the point\\nthat a simulation would create its own ‘laws of physics’ that would\\nlimit possibility. I’ve been making the same point for decades that\\nthe perceived laws of physics relate only to this reality, or what I\\nwould later call the simulation. When designers write codes to create\\ncomputer and virtual reality games they are the equivalent of the\\nlaws of physics for that game. Players interact within the limitations\\nlaid out by the coding. In the same way those who wrote the codes\\nfor the simulation decided the laws of physics that would apply.\\nThese can be overridden by expanded states of consciousness, but\\nnot by those enslaved in only ﬁve-sense awareness where simulation\\ncodes rule. Overriding the codes is what people call ‘miracles’. They\\nare not. They are bypassing the encoded limits of the simulation. A\\npopulation caught in simulation perception would have no idea that\\nthis was their plight. As the Bonn paper said: ‘Like a prisoner in a\\npitch-black cell we would not be able to see the “walls” of our\\nprison,’ That’s true if people remain mesmerised by the ﬁve senses.\\nOpen to expanded awareness and those walls become very clear. The\\nmain one is the speed of light.\\nAmerican theoretical physicist James Gates is another who has\\nexplored the simulation question and found considerable evidence\\nto support the idea. Gates was Professor of Physics at the University\\nof Maryland, Director of The Center for String and Particle Theory,\\nand on Barack Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and\\nTechnology. He and his team found computer codes of digital data\\nembedded in the fabric of our reality. They relate to on-oﬀ electrical\\ncharges of 1 and 0 in the binary system used by computers. ‘We have\\nno idea what they are doing there’, Gates said. They found within\\nthe energetic fabric mathematical sequences known as error-\\ncorrecting codes or block codes that ‘reboot’ data to its original state\\nor ‘default se\\x00ings’ when something knocks it out of sync. Gates was\\nasked if he had found a set of equations embedded in our reality\\nindistinguishable from those that drive search engines and browsers\\nand he said: ‘That is correct.’ Rich Terrile, director of the Centre for\\nEvolutionary Computation and Automated Design at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has said publicly that he believes the\\nUniverse is a digital hologram that must have been created by a form\\nof intelligence. I agree with that in every way. Waveform information\\nis delivered electrically by the senses to the brain which constructs a\\ndigital holographic reality that we call the ‘world’. This digital level\\nof reality can be read by the esoteric art of numerology. Digital\\nholograms are at the cu\\x00ing edge of holographics today. We have\\ndigital technology everywhere designed to access and manipulate\\nour digital level of perceived reality. Synthetic mRNA in ‘Covid\\nvaccines’ has a digital component to manipulate the body’s digital\\n‘operating system’.\\nReality is numbers\\nHow many know that our reality can be broken down to numbers\\nand codes that are the same as computer games? Max Tegmark, a\\nphysicist at the Massachuse\\x00s Institute of Technology (MIT), is the\\nauthor of Our Mathematical Universe in which he lays out how reality\\ncan be entirely described by numbers and maths in the way that a\\nvideo game is encoded with the ‘physics’ of computer games. Our\\nworld and computer virtual reality are essentially the same.\\nTegmark imagines the perceptions of characters in an advanced\\ncomputer game when the graphics are so good they don’t know they\\nare in a game. They think they can bump into real objects\\n(electromagnetic resistance in our reality), fall in love and feel\\nemotions like excitement. When they began to study the apparently\\n‘physical world’ of the video game they would realise that\\neverything was made of pixels (which have been found in our\\nenergetic reality as must be the case when on one level our world is\\ndigital). What computer game characters thought was physical\\n‘stuﬀ’, Tegmark said, could actually be broken down into numbers:\\nAnd we’re exactly in this situation in our world. We look around and it doesn’t seem that\\nmathematical at all, but everything we see is made out of elementary particles like quarks and\\nelectrons. And what properties does an electron have? Does it have a smell or a colour or a\\ntexture? No! ... We physicists have come up with geeky names for [Electron] properties, like electric charge, or spin, or lepton number, but the electron doesn’t care what we call it, the\\nproperties are just numbers.\\nThis is the illusory reality Gnostics were describing. This is the\\nsimulation. The A, C, G, and T codes of DNA have a binary value –\\nA and C = 0 while G and T = 1. This has to be when the simulation is\\ndigital and the body must be digital to interact with it. Recurring\\nmathematical sequences are encoded throughout reality and the\\nbody. They include the Fibonacci sequence in which the two\\nprevious numbers are added to get the next one, as in ... 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,\\n8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc. The sequence is encoded in the human face and\\nbody, proportions of animals, DNA, seed heads, pine cones, trees,\\nshells, spiral galaxies, hurricanes and the number of petals in a\\nﬂower. The list goes on and on. There are fractal pa\\x00erns – a ‘never-\\nending pa\\x00ern that is inﬁnitely complex and self-similar across all\\nscales in the as above, so below, principle of holograms. These and\\nother famous recurring geometrical and mathematical sequences\\nsuch as Phi, Pi, Golden Mean, Golden Ratio and Golden Section are\\ncomputer codes of the simulation. I had to laugh and give my head a\\nshake the day I ﬁnished this book and it went into the production\\nstage. I was sent an article in Scientific American published in April,\\n2021, with the headline ‘Conﬁrmed! We Live in a Simulation’. Two\\ndecades a\\x00er I ﬁrst said our reality is a simulation and the speed of\\nlight is it’s outer limit the article suggested that we do live in a\\nsimulation and that the speed of light is its outer limit. I le\\x00 school at\\n15 and never passed a major exam in my life while the writer was up\\nto his eyes in qualiﬁcations. As I will explain in the ﬁnal chapter\\nknowing is far be\\x00er than thinking and they come from very diﬀerent\\nsources. The article rightly connected the speed of light to the\\nprocessing speed of the ‘Matrix’ and said what has been in my books\\nall this time … ‘If we are in a simulation, as it appears, then space is\\nan abstract property wri\\x00en in code. It is not real’. No it’s not and if\\nwe live in a simulation something created it and it wasn’t us. ‘That\\nDavid Icke says we are manipulated by aliens’ – he’s crackers.’ Wow …\\nThe reality that humanity thinks is so real is an illusion. Politicians,\\ngovernments, scientists, doctors, academics, law enforcement,\\nmedia, school and university curriculums, on and on, are all\\nfounded on a world that does not exist except as a simulated prison\\ncell. Is it such a stretch to accept that ‘Covid’ doesn’t exist when our\\nentire ‘physical’ reality doesn’t exist? Revealed here is the\\nknowledge kept under raps in the Cult networks of\\ncompartmentalised secrecy to control humanity’s sense of reality by\\ninducing the population to believe in a reality that’s not real. If it\\nwasn’t so tragic in its experiential consequences the whole thing\\nwould be hysterically funny. None of this is new to Renegade Minds.\\nAncient Greek philosopher Plato (about 428 to about 347BC) was a\\nmajor inﬂuence on Gnostic belief and he described the human plight\\nthousands of years ago with his Allegory of the Cave. He told the\\nsymbolic story of prisoners living in a cave who had never been\\noutside. They were chained and could only see one wall of the cave\\nwhile behind them was a ﬁre that they could not see. Figures walked\\npast the ﬁre casting shadows on the prisoners’ wall and those\\nmoving shadows became their sense of reality. Some prisoners began\\nto study the shadows and were considered experts on them (today’s\\nacademics and scientists), but what they studied was only an illusion\\n(today’s academics and scientists). A prisoner escaped from the cave\\nand saw reality as it really is. When he returned to report this\\nrevelation they didn’t believe him, called him mad and threatened to\\nkill him if he tried to set them free. Plato’s tale is not only a brilliant\\nanalogy of the human plight and our illusory reality. It describes,\\ntoo, the dynamics of the ‘Covid’ hoax. I have only skimmed the\\nsurface of these subjects here. The aim of this book is to crisply\\nconnect all essential dots to put what is happening today into its true\\ncontext. All subject areas and their connections in this chapter are\\ncovered in great evidential detail in Everything You Need To Know,\\nBut Have Never Been Told and The Answer.\\nThey say that bewildered people ‘can’t see the forest for the trees’.\\nHumanity, however, can’t see the forest for the twigs. The ﬁve senses see only twigs while Renegade Minds can see the forest and it’s the\\nforest where the answers lie with the connections that reveals.\\nBreaking free of perceptual programming so the forest can be seen is\\nthe way we turn all this around. Not breaking free is how humanity\\ngot into this mess. The situation may seem hopeless, but I promise\\nyou it’s not. We are a perceptual heartbeat from paradise if only we\\nknew. R\\nCHAPTER TWELVE\\nEscaping Wetiko\\nLife is simply a vacation from the infinite\\nDean Cavanagh\\nenegade Minds weave the web of life and events and see\\ncommon themes in the apparently random. They are always\\nthere if you look for them and their pursuit is aided by incredible\\nsynchronicity that comes when your mind is open rather than\\nmesmerised by what it thinks it can see.\\nInﬁnite awareness is inﬁnite possibility and the more of inﬁnite\\npossibility that we access the more becomes inﬁnitely possible. That\\nmay be stating the apparently obvious, but it is a devastatingly-\\npowerful fact that can set us free. We are a point of a\\x00ention within\\nan inﬁnity of consciousness. The question is how much of that\\ninﬁnity do we choose to access? How much knowledge, insight,\\nawareness, wisdom, do we want to connect with and explore? If\\nyour focus is only in the ﬁve senses you will be inﬂuenced by a\\nfraction of inﬁnite awareness. I mean a range so tiny that it gives\\nnew meaning to inﬁnitesimal. Limitation of self-identity and a sense\\nof the possible limit accordingly your range of consciousness. We are\\nwhat we think we are. Life is what we think it is. The dream is the\\ndreamer and the dreamer is the dream. Buddhist philosophy puts it\\nthis way: ‘As a thing is viewed, so it appears.’ Most humans live in\\nthe realm of touch, taste, see, hear, and smell and that’s the limit of\\ntheir sense of the possible and sense of self. Many will follow a\\nreligion and speak of a God in his heaven, but their lives are still dominated by the ﬁve senses in their perceptions and actions. The\\nﬁve senses become the arbiter of everything. When that happens all\\nexcept a smear of inﬁnity is sealed away from inﬂuence by the rigid,\\nunyielding, reality bubbles that are the ﬁve-sense human or\\nPhantom Self. Archon Cult methodology is to isolate consciousness\\nwithin ﬁve-sense reality – the simulation – and then program that\\nconsciousness with a sense of self and the world through a deluge of\\nlife-long information designed to instil the desired perception that\\nallows global control. Eﬀorts to do this have increased dramatically\\nwith identity politics as identity bubbles are squeezed into the\\nminutiae of ﬁve-sense detail which disconnect people even more\\nprofoundly from the inﬁnite ‘I’.\\nFive-sense focus and self-identity are like a ﬁrewall that limits\\naccess to the inﬁnite realms. You only perceive one radio or\\ntelevision station and no other. We’ll take that literally for a moment.\\nImagine a vast array of stations giving diﬀerent information and\\nangles on reality, but you only ever listen to one. Here we have the\\nhuman plight in which the population is overwhelmingly conﬁned\\nto CultFM. This relates only to the frequency range of CultFM and\\nlimits perception and insight to that band – limits possibility to that\\nband. It means you are connecting with an almost imperceptibly\\nminuscule range of possibility and creative potential within the\\ninﬁnite Field. It’s a world where everything seems apart from\\neverything else and where synchronicity is rare. Synchronicity is\\ndeﬁned in the dictionary as ‘the happening by chance of two or more\\nrelated or similar events at the same time‘. Use of ‘by chance’ betrays\\na complete misunderstanding of reality. Synchronicity is not ‘by\\nchance’. As people open their minds, or ‘awaken’ to use the term,\\nthey notice more and more coincidences in their lives, bits of ‘luck’,\\napparently miraculous happenings that put them in the right place\\nat the right time with the right people. Days become peppered with\\n‘fancy meeting you here’ and ‘what are the chances of that?’ My\\nentire life has been lived like this and ever more so since my own\\ncolossal awakening in 1990 and 91 which transformed my sense of\\nreality. Synchronicity is not ‘by chance’; it is by accessing expanded realms of possibility which allow expanded potential for\\nmanifestation. People broadcasting the same vibe from the same\\nopenness of mind tend to be drawn ‘by chance’ to each other\\nthrough what I call frequency magnetism and it’s not only people. In\\nthe last more than 30 years incredible synchronicity has also led me\\nthrough the Cult maze to information in so many forms and to\\ncrucial personal experiences. These ‘coincidences’ have allowed me\\nto put the puzzle pieces together across an enormous array of\\nsubjects and situations. Those who have breached the bubble of ﬁve-\\nsense reality will know exactly what I mean and this escape from the\\nperceptual prison cell is open to everyone whenever they make that\\nchoice. This may appear super-human when compared with the\\nlimitations of ‘human’, but it’s really our natural state. ‘Human’ as\\ncurrently experienced is consciousness in an unnatural state of\\ninduced separation from the inﬁnity of the whole. I’ll come to how\\nthis transformation into unity can be made when I have described in\\nmore detail the force that holds humanity in servitude by denying\\nthis access to inﬁnite self.\\nThe Wetiko factor\\nI have been talking and writing for decades about the way ﬁve-sense\\nmind is systematically barricaded from expanded awareness. I have\\nused the analogy of a computer (ﬁve-sense mind) and someone at\\nthe keyboard (expanded awareness). Interaction between the\\ncomputer and the operator is symbolic of the interaction between\\nﬁve-sense mind and expanded awareness. The computer directly\\nexperiences the Internet and the operator experiences the Internet\\nvia the computer which is how it’s supposed to be – the two working\\nas one. Archons seek to control that point where the operator\\nconnects with the computer to stop that interaction (Fig 20). Now the\\noperator is banging the keyboard and clicking the mouse, but the\\ncomputer is not responding and this happens when the computer is\\ntaken over – possessed – by an appropriately-named computer ‘virus’.\\nThe operator has lost all inﬂuence over the computer which goes its\\nown way making decisions under the control of the ‘virus’. I have just described the dynamic through which the force known to\\nGnostics as Yaldabaoth and Archons disconnects ﬁve-sense mind\\nfrom expanded awareness to imprison humanity in perceptual\\nservitude.\\nFigure 20: The mind ‘virus’ I have been writing about for decades seeks to isolate five-sense\\nmind (the computer) from the true ‘I’. (Image by Neil Hague).\\nAbout a year ago I came across a Native American concept of\\nWetiko which describes precisely the same phenomenon. Wetiko is\\nthe spelling used by the Cree and there are other versions including\\nwintiko and windigo used by other tribal groups. They spell the\\nname with lower case, but I see Wetiko as a proper noun as with\\nArchons and prefer a capital. I ﬁrst saw an article about Wetiko by\\nwriter and researcher Paul Levy which so synced with what I had\\nbeen writing about the computer/operator disconnection and later\\nthe Archons. I then read his book, the fascinating Dispelling Wetiko,\\nBreaking the Spell of Evil. The parallels between what I had concluded\\nlong before and the Native American concept of Wetiko were so\\nclear and obvious that it was almost funny. For Wetiko see the\\nGnostic Archons for sure and the Jinn, the Predators, and every\\nother name for a force of evil, inversion and chaos. Wetiko is the\\nNative American name for the force that divides the computer from the operator (Fig 21). Indigenous author Jack D. Forbes, a founder of\\nthe Native American movement in the 1960s, wrote another book\\nabout Wetiko entitled Columbus And Other Cannibals – The Wetiko\\nDisease of Exploitation, Imperialism, and Terrorism which I also read.\\nForbes says that Wetiko refers to an evil person or spirit ‘who\\nterrorizes other creatures by means of terrible acts, including\\ncannibalism’. Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa told me that African\\naccounts tell how cannibalism was brought into the world by the\\nChitauri ‘gods’ – another manifestation of Wetiko. The distinction\\nbetween ‘evil person or spirit’ relates to Archons/Wetiko possessing\\na human or acting as pure consciousness. Wetiko is said to be a\\nsickness of the soul or spirit and a state of being that takes but gives\\nnothing back – the Cult and its operatives perfectly described. Black\\nHawk, a Native American war leader defending their lands from\\nconﬁscation, said European invaders had ‘poisoned hearts’ – Wetiko\\nhearts – and that this would spread to native societies. Mention of\\nthe heart is very signiﬁcant as we shall shortly see. Forbes writes:\\n‘Tragically, the history of the world for the past 2,000 years is, in\\ngreat part, the story of the epidemiology of the wetiko disease.’ Yes,\\nand much longer. Forbes is correct when he says: ‘The wetikos\\ndestroyed Egypt and Babylon and Athens and Rome and\\nTenochtitlan [capital of the Aztec empire] and perhaps now they will\\ndestroy the entire earth.’ Evil, he said, is the number one export of a\\nWetiko culture – see its globalisation with ‘Covid’. Constant war,\\nmass murder, suﬀering of all kinds, child abuse, Satanism, torture\\nand human sacriﬁce are all expressions of Wetiko and the Wetiko\\npossessed. The world is Wetiko made manifest, but it doesn’t have to\\nbe. There is a way out of this even now. Figure 21: The mind ‘virus’ is known to Native Americans as ‘Wetiko’. (Image by Neil Hague).\\nCult of Wetiko\\nWetiko is the Yaldabaoth frequency distortion that seeks to a\\x00ach to\\nhuman consciousness and absorb it into its own. Once this\\nconnection is made Wetiko can drive the perceptions of the target\\nwhich they believe to be coming from their own mind. All the\\nhorrors of history and today from mass killers to Satanists,\\npaedophiles like Jeﬀrey Epstein and other psychopaths, are the\\nembodiment of Wetiko and express its state of being in all its\\ngrotesqueness. The Cult is Wetiko incarnate, Yaldabaoth incarnate,\\nand it seeks to facilitate Wetiko assimilation of humanity in totality\\ninto its distortion by manipulating the population into low\\nfrequency states that match its own. Paul Levy writes:\\n‘Holographically enforced within the psyche of every human being\\nthe wetiko virus pervades and underlies the entire ﬁeld of\\nconsciousness, and can therefore potentially manifest through any\\none of us at any moment if we are not mindful.’ The ‘Covid’ hoax\\nhas achieved this with many people, but others have not fallen into\\nWetiko’s frequency lair. Players in the ‘Covid’ human catastrophe\\nincluding Gates, Schwab, Tedros, Fauci, Whi\\x00y, Vallance, Johnson,\\nHancock, Ferguson, Drosten, and all the rest, including the\\npsychopath psychologists, are expressions of Wetiko. This is why they have no compassion or empathy and no emotional consequence\\nfor what they do that would make them stop doing it. Observe all\\nthe people who support the psychopaths in authority against the\\nPushbackers despite the damaging impact the psychopaths have on\\ntheir own lives and their family’s lives. You are again looking at\\nWetiko possession which prevents them seeing through the lies to\\nthe obvious scam going on. Why can’t they see it? Wetiko won’t let\\nthem see it. The perceptual divide that has now become a chasm is\\nbetween the Wetikoed and the non-Wetikoed.\\nPaul Levy describes Wetiko in the same way that I have long\\ndescribed the Archontic force. They are the same distorted\\nconsciousness operating across dimensions of reality: ‘… the subtle\\nbody of wetiko is not located in the third dimension of space and\\ntime, literally existing in another dimension … it is able to aﬀect\\nordinary lives by mysteriously interpenetrating into our three-\\ndimensional world.’ Wetiko does this through its incarnate\\nrepresentatives in the Cult and by weaving itself into The Field\\nwhich on our level of reality is the electromagnetic information ﬁeld\\nof the simulation or Matrix. More than that, the simulation is Wetiko\\n/ Yaldabaoth. Caleb Scharf, Director of Astrobiology at Columbia\\nUniversity, has speculated that ‘alien life’ could be so advanced that\\nit has transcribed itself into the quantum realm to become what we\\ncall physics. He said intelligence indistinguishable from the fabric of\\nthe Universe would solve many of its greatest mysteries:\\nPerhaps hyper-advanced life isn’t just external. Perhaps it’s already all around. It is embedded\\nin what we perceive to be physics itself, from the root behaviour of particles and fields to the\\nphenomena of complexity and emergence ... In other words, life might not just be in the\\nequations. It might BE the equations [My emphasis].\\nScharf said it is possible that ‘we don’t recognise advanced life\\nbecause it forms an integral and unsuspicious part of what we’ve\\nconsidered to be the natural world’. I agree. Wetiko/Yaldabaoth is the\\nsimulation. We are literally in the body of the beast. But that doesn’t\\nmean it has to control us. We all have the power to overcome Wetiko inﬂuence and the Cult knows that. I doubt it sleeps too well because\\nit knows that.\\nWhich Field?\\nThis, I suggest, is how it all works. There are two Fields. One is the\\nﬁerce electromagnetic light of the Matrix within the speed of light;\\nthe other is the ‘watery light’ of The Field beyond the walls of the\\nMatrix that connects with the Great Inﬁnity. Five-sense mind and the\\ndecoding systems of the body a\\x00ach us to the Field of Matrix light.\\nThey have to or we could not experience this reality. Five-sense mind\\nsees only the Matrix Field of information while our expanded\\nconsciousness is part of the Inﬁnity Field. When we open our minds,\\nand most importantly our hearts, to the Inﬁnity Field we have a\\nmission control which gives us an expanded perspective, a road\\nmap, to understand the nature of the ﬁve-sense world. If we are\\nisolated only in ﬁve-sense mind there is no mission control. We’re on\\nour own trying to understand a world that’s constantly feeding us\\ninformation to ensure we do not understand. People in this state can\\nfeel ‘lost’ and bewildered with no direction or radar. You can see\\never more clearly those who are inﬂuenced by the Fields of Big\\nInﬁnity or li\\x00le ﬁve-sense mind simply by their views and behaviour\\nwith regard to the ‘Covid’ hoax. We have had this division\\nthroughout known human history with the mass of the people on\\none side and individuals who could see and intuit beyond the walls\\nof the simulation – Plato’s prisoner who broke out of the cave and\\nsaw reality for what it is. Such people have always been targeted by\\nWetiko/Archon-possessed authority, burned at the stake or\\ndemonised as mad, bad and dangerous. The Cult today and its\\nglobal network of ‘anti-hate’, ‘anti-fascist’ Woke groups are all\\nexpressions of Wetiko a\\x00acking those exposing the conspiracy,\\n‘Covid’ lies and the ‘vaccine’ agenda.\\nWoke as a whole is Wetiko which explains its black and white\\nmentality and how at one it is with the Wetiko-possessed Cult. Paul\\nLevy said: ‘To be in this paradigm is to still be under the thrall of a\\ntwo-valued logic – where things are either true or false – of a wetikoized mind.’ Wetiko consciousness is in a permanent rage,\\ntherefore so is Woke, and then there is Woke inversion and\\ncontradiction. ‘Anti-fascists’ act like fascists because fascists and ‘anti-\\nfascists’ are both Wetiko at work. Political parties act the same while\\nclaiming to be diﬀerent for the same reason. Secret society and\\nsatanic rituals are a\\x00aching initiates to Wetiko and the cold, ruthless,\\npsychopathic mentality that secures the positions of power all over\\nthe world is Wetiko. Reframing ‘training programmes’ have the\\nsame cumulative eﬀect of a\\x00aching Wetiko and we have their\\ngraduates described as automatons and robots with a cold,\\npsychopathic, uncaring demeanour. They are all traits of Wetiko\\npossession and look how many times they have been described in\\nthis book and elsewhere with regard to personnel behind ‘Covid’\\nincluding the police and medical profession. Climbing the greasy\\npole in any profession in a Wetiko society requires traits of Wetiko to\\nget there and that is particularly true of politics which is not about\\nfair competition and pre-eminence of ideas. It is founded on how\\nmany backs you can stab and arses you can lick. This culminated in\\nthe global ‘Covid’ coordination between the Wetiko possessed who\\npulled it oﬀ in all the diﬀerent countries without a trace of empathy\\nand compassion for their impact on humans. Our sight sense can see\\nonly holographic form and not the Field which connects holographic\\nform. Therefore we perceive ‘physical’ objects with ‘space’ in\\nbetween. In fact that ‘space’ is energy/consciousness operating on\\nmultiple frequencies. One of them is Wetiko and that connects the\\nCult psychopaths, those who submit to the psychopaths, and those\\nwho serve the psychopaths in the media operations of the world.\\nWetiko is Gates. Wetiko is the mask-wearing submissive. Wetiko is\\nthe fake journalist and ‘fact-checker’. The Wetiko Field is\\ncoordinating the whole thing. Psychopaths, gofers, media\\noperatives, ‘anti-hate’ hate groups, ‘fact-checkers’ and submissive\\npeople work as one unit even without human coordination because they\\nare a\\x00ached to the same Field which is organising it all (Fig 22). Paul\\nLevy is here describing how Wetiko-possessed people are drawn\\ntogether and refuse to let any information breach their rigid perceptions. He was writing long before ‘Covid’, but I think you will\\nrecognise followers of the ‘Covid’ religion oh just a little bit:\\nPeople who are channelling the vibratory frequency of wetiko align with each other through\\npsychic resonance to reinforce their unspoken shared agreement so as to uphold their\\nderanged view of reality. Once an unconscious content takes possession of certain\\nindividuals, it irresistibly draws them together by mutual attraction and knits them into groups\\ntied together by their shared madness that can easily swell into an avalanche of insanity.\\nA psychic epidemic is a closed system, which is to say that it is insular and not open to any\\nnew information or informing influences from the outside world which contradict its fixed,\\nlimited, and limiting perspective.\\nThere we have the Woke mind and the ‘Covid’ mind. Compatible\\nresonance draws the awakening together, too, which is clearly\\nhappening today.\\nFigure 22: The Wetiko Field from which the Cult pyramid and its personnel are made\\nmanifest. (Image by Neil Hague).\\nSpiritual servitude\\nWetiko doesn’t care about humans. It’s not human; it just possesses\\nhumans for its own ends and the eﬀect (depending on the scale of possession) can be anything from extreme psychopathy to\\nunquestioning obedience. Wetiko’s worst nightmare is for human\\nconsciousness to expand beyond the simulation. Everything is\\nfocussed on stopping that happening through control of\\ninformation, thus perception, thus frequency. The ‘education\\nsystem’, media, science, medicine, academia, are all geared to\\nmaintaining humanity in ﬁve-sense servitude as is the constant\\nstimulation of low-vibrational mental and emotional states (see\\n‘Covid’). Wetiko seeks to dominate those subconscious spaces\\nbetween ﬁve-sense perception and expanded consciousness where\\nthe computer meets the operator. From these subconscious hiding\\nplaces Wetiko speaks to us to trigger urges and desires that we take\\nto be our own and manipulate us into anything from low-vibrational\\nto psychopathic states. Remember how Islam describes the Jinn as\\ninvisible tricksters that ‘whisper’ and confuse. Wetiko is the origin of\\nthe ‘trickster god’ theme that you ﬁnd in cultures all over the world.\\nJinn, like the Archons, are Wetiko which is terriﬁed of humans\\nawakening and reconnecting with our true self for then its energy\\nsource has gone. With that the feedback loop breaks between Wetiko\\nand human perception that provides the energetic momentum on\\nwhich its very existence depends as a force of evil. Humans are both\\nits target and its source of survival, but only if we are operating in\\nlow-vibrational states of fear, hate, depression and the background\\nanxiety that most people suﬀer. We are Wetiko’s target because we\\nare its key to survival. It needs us, not the other way round. Paul\\nLevy writes:\\nA vampire has no intrinsic, independent, substantial existence in its own right; it only exists in\\nrelation to us. The pathogenic, vampiric mind-parasite called wetiko is nothing in itself – not\\nbeing able to exist from its own side – yet it has a ‘virtual reality’ such that it can potentially\\ndestroy our species …\\n…The fact that a vampire is not reflected by a mirror can also mean that what we need to see\\nis that there’s nothing, no-thing to see, other than ourselves. The fact that wetiko is the\\nexpression of something inside of us means that the cure for wetiko is with us as well. The\\ncritical issue is finding this cure within us and then putting it into effect. Evil begets evil because if evil does not constantly expand and\\nﬁnd new sources of energetic sustenance its evil, its distortion, dies\\nwith the assimilation into balance and harmony. Love is the garlic to\\nWetiko’s vampire. Evil, the absence of love, cannot exist in the\\npresence of love. I think I see a way out of here. I have emphasised\\nso many times over the decades that the Archons/Wetiko and their\\nCult are not all powerful. They are not. I don’t care how it looks even\\nnow they are not. I have not called them li\\x00le boys in short trousers\\nfor eﬀect. I have said it because it is true. Wetiko’s insatiable desire\\nfor power over others is not a sign of its omnipotence, but its\\ninsecurity. Paul Levy writes: ‘Due to the primal fear which\\nultimately drives it and which it is driven to cultivate, wetiko’s body\\npolitic has an intrinsic and insistent need for centralising power and\\ncontrol so as to create imagined safety for itself.’ Yeeeeeees! Exactly!\\nWhy does Wetiko want humans in an ongoing state of fear? Wetiko\\nitself is fear and it is petriﬁed of love. As evil is an absence of love, so\\nlove is an absence of fear. Love conquers all and especially Wetiko\\nwhich is fear. Wetiko brought fear into the world when it wasn’t here\\nbefore. Fear was the ‘fall’, the fall into low-frequency ignorance and\\nillusion – fear is False Emotion Appearing Real. The simulation is\\ndriven and energised by fear because Wetiko/Yaldabaoth (fear) are\\nthe simulation. Fear is the absence of love and Wetiko is the absence\\nof love.\\nWetiko today\\nWe can now view current events from this level of perspective. The\\n‘Covid’ hoax has generated momentous amounts of ongoing fear,\\nanxiety, depression and despair which have empowered Wetiko. No\\nwonder people like Gates have been the instigators when they are\\nWetiko incarnate and exhibit every trait of Wetiko in the extreme.\\nSee how cold and unemotional these people are like Gates and his\\ncronies, how dead of eye they are. That’s Wetiko. Sabbatians are\\nWetiko and everything they control including the World Health\\nOrganization, Big Pharma and the ‘vaccine’ makers, national ‘health’ hierarchies, corporate media, Silicon Valley, the banking system, and\\nthe United Nations with its planned transformation into world\\ngovernment. All are controlled and possessed by the Wetiko\\ndistortion into distorting human society in its image. We are with\\nthis knowledge at the gateway to understanding the world.\\nDivisions of race, culture, creed and sexuality are diversions to hide\\nthe real division between those possessed and inﬂuenced by Wetiko\\nand those that are not. The ‘Covid’ hoax has brought both clearly\\ninto view. Human behaviour is not about race. Tyrants and\\ndictatorships come in all colours and creeds. What unites the US\\npresident bombing the innocent and an African tribe commi\\x00ing\\ngenocide against another as in Rwanda? What unites them? Wetiko.\\nAll wars are Wetiko, all genocide is Wetiko, all hunger over centuries\\nin a world of plenty is Wetiko. Children going to bed hungry,\\nincluding in the West, is Wetiko. Cult-generated Woke racial\\ndivisions that focus on the body are designed to obscure the reality\\nthat divisions in behaviour are manifestations of mind, not body.\\nObsession with body identity and group judgement is a means to\\ndivert a\\x00ention from the real source of behaviour – mind and\\nperception. Conﬂict sown by the Woke both within themselves and\\nwith their target groups are Wetiko providing lunch for itself\\nthrough still more agents of the division, chaos, and fear on which it\\nfeeds. The Cult is seeking to assimilate the entirety of humanity and\\nall children and young people into the Wetiko frequency by\\nmanipulating them into states of fear and despair. Witness all the\\nsuicide and psychological unravelling since the spring of 2020.\\nWetiko psychopaths want to impose a state of unquestioning\\nobedience to authority which is no more than a conduit for Wetiko to\\nenforce its will and assimilate humanity into itself. It needs us to\\nbelieve that resistance is futile when it fears resistance and even\\nmore so the game-changing non-cooperation with its impositions. It\\ncan use violent resistance for its beneﬁt. Violent impositions and\\nviolent resistance are both Wetiko. The Power of Love with its Power\\nof No will sweep Wetiko from our world. Wetiko and its Cult know\\nthat. They just don’t want us to know. AI Wetiko\\nThis brings me to AI or artiﬁcial intelligence and something else\\nWetikos don’t want us to know. What is AI really? I know about\\ncomputer code algorithms and AI that learns from data input. These,\\nhowever, are more diversions, the expeditionary force, for the real AI\\nthat they want to connect to the human brain as promoted by Silicon\\nValley Wetikos like Kurzweil. What is this AI? It is the frequency of\\nWetiko, the frequency of the Archons. The connection of AI to the\\nhuman brain is the connection of the Wetiko frequency to create a\\nWetiko hive mind and complete the job of assimilation. The hive\\nmind is planned to be controlled from Israel and China which are\\nboth 100 percent owned by Wetiko Sabbatians. The assimilation\\nprocess has been going on minute by minute in the ‘smart’ era which\\nfused with the ‘Covid’ era. We are told that social media is\\nscrambling the minds of the young and changing their personality.\\nThis is true, but what is social media? Look more deeply at how it\\nworks, how it creates divisions and conﬂict, the hostility and cruelty,\\nthe targeting of people until they are destroyed. That’s Wetiko. Social\\nmedia is manipulated to tune people to the Wetiko frequency with\\nall the emotional exploitation tricks employed by platforms like\\nFacebook and its Wetiko front man, Zuckerberg. Facebook’s\\nInstagram announced a new platform for children to overcome a\\nlegal bar on them using the main site. This is more Wetiko\\nexploitation and manipulation of kids. Amnesty International\\nlikened the plan to foxes oﬀering to guard the henhouse and said it\\nwas incompatible with human rights. Since when did Wetiko or\\nZuckerberg (I repeat myself) care about that? Would Brin and Page\\nat Google, Wojcicki at YouTube, Bezos at Amazon and whoever the\\nhell runs Twi\\x00er act as they do if they were not channelling Wetiko?\\nWould those who are developing technologies for no other reason\\nthan human control? How about those designing and selling\\ntechnologies to kill people and Big Pharma drug and ‘vaccine’\\nproducers who know they will end or devastate lives? Quite a\\nthought for these people to consider is that if you are Wetiko in a\\nhuman life you are Wetiko on the ‘other side’ unless your frequency changes and that can only change by a change of perception which\\nbecomes a change of behaviour. Where Gates is going does not bear\\nthinking about although perhaps that’s exactly where he wants to go.\\nEither way, that’s where he’s going. His frequency will make it so.\\nThe frequency lair\\nI have been saying for a long time that a big part of the addiction to\\nsmartphones and devices is that a frequency is coming oﬀ them that\\nentraps the mind. People spend ages on their phones and sometimes\\neven a minute or so a\\x00er they put them down they pick them up\\nagain and it all repeats. ‘Covid’ lockdowns will have increased this\\naddiction a million times for obvious reasons. Addictions to alcohol\\noverindulgence and drugs are another way that Wetiko entraps\\nconsciousness to a\\x00ach to its own. Both are symptoms of low-\\nvibrational psychological distress which alcoholism and drug\\naddiction further compound. Do we think it’s really a coincidence\\nthat access to them is made so easy while potions that can take\\npeople into realms beyond the simulation are banned and illegal? I\\nhave explored smartphone addiction in other books, the scale is\\nmind-blowing, and that level of addiction does not come without\\nhelp. Tech companies that make these phones are Wetiko and they\\nwill have no qualms about destroying the minds of children. We are\\nseeing again with these companies the Wetiko perceptual\\ncombination of psychopathic enforcers and weak and meek\\nunquestioning compliance by the rank and ﬁle.\\nThe global Smart Grid is the Wetiko Grid and it is crucial to\\ncomplete the Cult endgame. The simulation is radiation and we are\\nbeing deluged with technological radiation on a devastating scale.\\nWetiko frauds like Elon Musk serve Cult interests while occasionally\\ncriticising them to maintain his street-cred. 5G and other forms of\\nWi-Fi are being directed at the earth from space on a volume and\\nscale that goes on increasing by the day. Elon Musk’s (oﬃcially)\\nSpaceX Starlink project is in the process of pu\\x00ing tens of thousands\\nof satellites in low orbit to cover every inch of the planet with 5G\\nand other Wi-Fi to create Kurzweil’s global ‘cloud’ to which the human mind is planned to be a\\x00ached very soon. SpaceX has\\napproval to operate 12,000 satellites with more than 1,300 launched\\nat the time of writing and applications ﬁled for 30,000 more. Other\\noperators in the Wi-Fi, 5G, low-orbit satellite market include\\nOneWeb (UK), Telesat (Canada), and AST & Science (US). Musk tells\\nus that AI could be the end of humanity and then launches a\\ncompany called Neuralink to connect the human brain to computers.\\nMusk’s (in theory) Tesla company is building electric cars and the\\ndriverless vehicles of the smart control grid. As frauds and\\nbullshi\\x00ers go Elon Musk in my opinion is Major League.\\n5G and technological radiation in general are destructive to\\nhuman health, genetics and psychology and increasing the strength\\nof artiﬁcial radiation underpins the ﬁve-sense perceptual bubbles\\nwhich are themselves expressions of radiation or electromagnetism.\\nFreedom activist John Whitehead was so right with his ‘databit by\\ndatabit, we are building our own electronic concentration camps’.\\nThe Smart Grid and 5G is a means to control the human mind and\\ninfuse perceptual information into The Field to inﬂuence anyone in\\nsync with its frequency. You can change perception and behaviour\\nen masse if you can manipulate the population into those levels of\\nfrequency and this is happening all around us today. The arrogance\\nof Musk and his fellow Cult operatives knows no bounds in the way\\nthat we see with Gates. Musk’s satellites are so many in number\\nalready they are changing the night sky when viewed from Earth.\\nThe astronomy community has complained about this and they have\\nseen nothing yet. Some consequences of Musk’s Wetiko hubris\\ninclude: Radiation; visible pollution of the night sky; interference\\nwith astronomy and meteorology; ground and water pollution from\\nintensive use of increasingly many spaceports; accumulating space\\ndebris; continual deorbiting and burning up of aging satellites,\\npolluting the atmosphere with toxic dust and smoke; and ever-\\nincreasing likelihood of collisions. A collective public open le\\x00er of\\ncomplaint to Musk said:\\nWe are writing to you … because SpaceX is in process of surrounding the Earth with a\\nnetwork of thousands of satellites whose very purpose is to irradiate every square inch of the Earth. SpaceX, like everyone else, is treating the radiation as if it were not there. As if the\\nmitochondria in our cells do not depend on electrons moving undisturbed from the food we\\ndigest to the oxygen we breathe.\\nAs if our nervous systems and our hearts are not subject to radio frequency interference like\\nany piece of electronic equipment. As if the cancer, diabetes, and heart disease that now\\nafflict a majority of the Earth’s population are not metabolic diseases that result from\\ninterference with our cellular machinery. As if insects everywhere, and the birds and animals\\nthat eat them, are not starving to death as a result.\\nPeople like Musk and Gates believe in their limitless Wetiko\\narrogance that they can do whatever they like to the world because\\nthey own it. Consequences for humanity are irrelevant. It’s\\nabsolutely time that we stopped taking this shit from these self-\\nstyled masters of the Earth when you consider where this is going.\\nWhy is the Cult so anti-human?\\nI hear this question o\\x00en: Why would they do this when it will aﬀect\\nthem, too? Ah, but will it? Who is this them? Forget their bodies.\\nThey are just vehicles for Wetiko consciousness. When you break it\\nall down to the foundations we are looking at a state of severely\\ndistorted consciousness targeting another state of consciousness for\\nassimilation. The rest is detail. The simulation is the ﬂy-trap in\\nwhich unique sensations of the ﬁve senses create a cycle of addiction\\ncalled reincarnation. Renegade Minds see that everything which\\nhappens in our reality is a smaller version of the whole picture in\\nline with the holographic principle. Addiction to the radiation of\\nsmart technology is a smaller version of addiction to the whole\\nsimulation. Connecting the body/brain to AI is taking that addiction\\non a giant step further to total ongoing control by assimilating\\nhuman incarnate consciousness into Wetiko. I have watched during\\nthe ‘Covid’ hoax how many are becoming ever more profoundly\\na\\x00ached to Wetiko’s perceptual calling cards of aggressive response\\nto any other point of view (‘There is no other god but me’),\\npsychopathic lack of compassion and empathy, and servile\\nsubmission to the narrative and will of authority. Wetiko is the\\npsychopaths and subservience to psychopaths. The Cult of Wetiko is so anti-human because it is not human. It embarked on a mission to\\ndestroy human by targeting everything that it means to be human\\nand to survive as human. ‘Covid’ is not the end, just a means to an\\nend. The Cult with its Wetiko consciousness is seeking to change\\nEarth systems, including the atmosphere, to suit them, not humans.\\nThe gathering bombardment of 5G alone from ground and space is\\ndramatically changing The Field with which the ﬁve senses interact.\\nThere is so much more to come if we sit on our hands and hope it\\nwill all go away. It is not meant to go away. It is meant to get ever\\nmore extreme and we need to face that while we still can – just.\\nCarbon dioxide is the gas of life. Without that human is over.\\nKaput, gone, history. No natural world, no human. The Cult has\\ncreated a cock and bull story about carbon dioxide and climate\\nchange to justify its reduction to the point where Gates and the\\nignoramus Biden ‘climate chief’ John Kerry want to suck it out of the\\natmosphere. Kerry wants to do this because his master Gates does.\\nWetikos have made the gas of life a demon with the usual support\\nfrom the Wokers of Extinction Rebellion and similar organisations\\nand the bewildered puppet-child that is Greta Thunberg who was\\nput on the world stage by Klaus Schwab and the World Economic\\nForum. The name Extinction Rebellion is both ironic and as always\\nWetiko inversion. The gas that we need to survive must be reduced\\nto save us from extinction. The most basic need of human is oxygen\\nand we now have billions walking around in face nappies depriving\\nbody and brain of this essential requirement of human existence.\\nMore than that 5G at 60 gigahertz interacts with the oxygen\\nmolecule to reduce the amount of oxygen the body can absorb into\\nthe bloodstream. The obvious knock-on consequences of that for\\nrespiratory and cognitive problems and life itself need no further\\nexplanation. Psychopaths like Musk are assembling a global system\\nof satellites to deluge the human atmosphere with this insanity. The\\nman should be in jail. Here we have two most basic of human needs,\\noxygen and carbon dioxide, being dismantled.\\nTwo others, water and food, are ge\\x00ing similar treatment with the\\nUnited Nations Agendas 21 and 2030 – the Great Reset – planning to centrally control all water and food supplies. People will not even\\nown rain water that falls on their land. Food is aﬀected at the most\\nbasic level by reducing carbon dioxide. We have genetic modiﬁcation\\nor GMO inﬁltrating the food chain on a mass scale, pesticides and\\nherbicides polluting the air and destroying the soil. Freshwater ﬁsh\\nthat provide livelihoods for 60 million people and feed hundreds of\\nmillions worldwide are being ‘pushed to the brink’ according the\\nconservationists while climate change is the only focus. Now we\\nhave Gates and Schwab wanting to dispense with current food\\nsources all together and replace them with a synthetic version which\\nthe Wetiko Cult would control in terms of production and who eats\\nand who doesn’t. We have been on the Totalitarian Tiptoe to this for\\nmore than 60 years as food has become ever more processed and full\\nof chemical shite to the point today when it’s not natural food at all.\\nAs Dr Tom Cowan says: ‘If it has a label don’t eat it.’ Bill Gates is\\nnow the biggest owner of farmland in the United States and he does\\nnothing without an ulterior motive involving the Cult. Klaus Schwab\\nwrote: ‘To feed the world in the next 50 years we will need to\\nproduce as much food as was produced in the last 10,000 years …\\nfood security will only be achieved, however, if regulations on\\ngenetically modiﬁed foods are adapted to reﬂect the reality that gene\\nediting oﬀers a precise, eﬃcient and safe method of improving\\ncrops.’ Liar. People and the world are being targeted with\\naluminium through vaccines, chemtrails, food, drink cans, and\\nendless other sources when aluminium has been linked to many\\nhealth issues including dementia which is increasing year a\\x00er year.\\nInsects, bees and wildlife essential to the food chain are being\\ndeleted by pesticides, herbicides and radiation which 5G is\\ndramatically increasing with 6G and 7G to come. The pollinating bee\\npopulation is being devastated while wildlife including birds,\\ndolphins and whales are having their natural radar blocked by the\\neﬀects of ever-increasing radiation. In the summer windscreens used\\nto be spla\\x00ered with insects so numerous were they. It doesn’t\\nhappen now. Where have they gone? Synthetic everything\\nThe Cult is introducing genetically-modiﬁed versions of trees, plants\\nand insects including a Gates-funded project to unleash hundreds of\\nmillions of genetically-modiﬁed, lab-altered and patented male\\nmosquitoes to mate with wild mosquitoes and induce genetic ﬂaws\\nthat cause them to die out. Clinically-insane Gates-funded Japanese\\nresearchers have developed mosquitos that spread vaccine and are\\ndubbed ‘ﬂying vaccinators’. Gates is funding the modiﬁcation of\\nweather pa\\x00erns in part to sell the myth that this is caused by carbon\\ndioxide and he’s funding geoengineering of the skies to change the\\natmosphere. Some of this came to light with the Gates-backed plan\\nto release tonnes of chalk into the atmosphere to ‘deﬂect the Sun and\\ncool the planet’. Funny how they do this while the heating eﬀect of\\nthe Sun is not factored into climate projections focussed on carbon\\ndioxide. The reason is that they want to reduce carbon dioxide (so\\ndon’t mention the Sun), but at the same time they do want to reduce\\nthe impact of the Sun which is so essential to human life and health.\\nI have mentioned the sun-cholesterol-vitamin D connection as they\\ndemonise the Sun with warnings about skin cancer (caused by the\\nchemicals in sun cream they tell you to splash on). They come from\\nthe other end of the process with statin drugs to reduce cholesterol\\nthat turns sunlight into vitamin D. A lack of vitamin D leads to a\\nlong list of health eﬀects and how vitamin D levels must have fallen\\nwith people conﬁned to their homes over ‘Covid’. Gates is funding\\nother forms of geoengineering and most importantly chemtrails\\nwhich are dropping heavy metals, aluminium and self-replicating\\nnanotechnology onto the Earth which is killing the natural world.\\nSee Everything You Need To Know, But Have Never Been Told for the\\ndetailed background to this.\\nEvery human system is being targeted for deletion by a force that’s\\nnot human. The Wetiko Cult has embarked on the process of\\ntransforming the human body from biological to synthetic biological\\nas I have explained. Biological is being replaced by the artiﬁcial and\\nsynthetic – Archontic ‘countermimicry’ – right across human society.\\nThe plan eventually is to dispense with the human body altogether and absorb human consciousness – which it wouldn’t really be by\\nthen – into cyberspace (the simulation which is Wetiko/Yaldabaoth).\\nPreparations for that are already happening if people would care to\\nlook. The alternative media rightly warns about globalism and ‘the\\nglobalists’, but this is far bigger than that and represents the end of\\nthe human race as we know it. The ‘bad copy’ of prime reality that\\nGnostics describe was a bad copy of harmony, wonder and beauty to\\nstart with before Wetiko/Yaldabaoth set out to change the simulated\\n‘copy’ into something very diﬀerent. The process was slow to start\\nwith. Entrapped humans in the simulation timeline were not\\ntechnologically aware and they had to be brought up to intellectual\\nspeed while being suppressed spiritually to the point where they\\ncould build their own prison while having no idea they were doing\\nso. We have now reached that stage where technological intellect has\\nthe potential to destroy us and that’s why events are moving so fast.\\nCentral American shaman Don Juan Matus said:\\nThink for a moment, and tell me how you would explain the contradictions between the\\nintelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems of belief, or the stupidity of\\nhis contradictory behaviour. Sorcerers believe that the predators have given us our systems of\\nbeliefs, our ideas of good and evil; our social mores. They are the ones who set up our dreams\\nof success or failure. They have given us covetousness, greed, and cowardice. It is the\\npredator who makes us complacent, routinary, and egomaniacal.\\nIn order to keep us obedient and meek and weak, the predators engaged themselves in a\\nstupendous manoeuvre – stupendous, of course, from the point of view of a fighting strategist;\\na horrendous manoeuvre from the point of those who suffer it. They gave us their mind. The\\npredators’ mind is baroque, contradictory, morose, filled with the fear of being discovered any\\nminute now.\\nFor ‘predators’ see Wetiko, Archons, Yaldabaoth, Jinn, and all the\\nother versions of the same phenomenon in cultures and religions all\\nover the world. The theme is always the same because it’s true and\\nit’s real. We have reached the point where we have to deal with it.\\nThe question is – how?\\nDon’t fight – walk away I thought I’d use a controversial subheading to get things moving in\\nterms of our response to global fascism. What do you mean ‘don’t\\nﬁght’? What do you mean ‘walk away’? We’ve got to ﬁght. We can’t\\nwalk away. Well, it depends what we mean by ﬁght and walk away.\\nIf ﬁghting means physical combat we are playing Wetiko’s game and\\nfalling for its trap. It wants us to get angry, aggressive, and direct\\nhate and hostility at the enemy we think we must ﬁght. Every war,\\nevery ba\\x00le, every conﬂict, has been fought with Wetiko leading\\nboth sides. It’s what it does. Wetiko wants a ﬁght, anywhere, any\\nplace. Just hit me, son, so I can hit you back. Wetiko hits Wetiko and\\nWetiko hits Wetiko in return. I am very forthright as you can see in\\nexposing Wetikos of the Cult, but I don’t hate them. I refuse to hate\\nthem. It’s what they want. What you hate you become. What you\\nfight you become. Wokers, ‘anti-haters’ and ‘anti-fascists’ prove this\\nevery time they reach for their keyboards or don their balaclavas. By\\nwalk away I mean to disengage from Wetiko which includes ceasing\\nto cooperate with its tyranny. Paul Levy says of Wetiko:\\nThe way to ‘defeat’ evil is not to try to destroy it (for then, in playing evil’s game, we have\\nalready lost), but rather, to find the invulnerable place within ourselves where evil is unable to\\nvanquish us – this is to truly ‘win’ our battle with evil.\\nWetiko is everywhere in human society and it’s been on steroids\\nsince the ‘Covid’ hoax. Every shouting match over wearing masks\\nhas Wetiko wearing a mask and Wetiko not wearing one. It’s an\\nelectrical circuit of push and resist, push and resist, with Wetiko\\npushing and resisting. Each polarity is Wetiko empowering itself.\\nDictionary deﬁnitions of ‘resist’ include ‘opposing, refusing to accept\\nor comply with’ and the word to focus on is ‘opposing’. What form\\ndoes this take – se\\x00ing police cars alight or ‘refusing to accept or\\ncomply with’? The former is Wetiko opposing Wetiko while the\\nother points the way forward. This is the diﬀerence between those\\naggressively demanding that government fascism must be obeyed\\nwho stand in stark contrast to the great majority of Pushbackers. We\\nsaw this clearly with a march by thousands of Pushbackers against\\nlockdown in London followed days later by a Woker-hĳacked protest in Bristol in which police cars were set on ﬁre. Masks were\\nvirtually absent in London and widespread in Bristol. Wetiko wants\\nlockdown on every level of society and infuses its aggression to\\npolice it through its unknowing stooges. Lockdown protesters are\\nthe ones with the smiling faces and the hugs, The two blatantly\\nobvious states of being – ge\\x00ing more obvious by the day – are the\\nresult of Wokers and their like becoming ever more inﬂuenced by\\nthe simulation Field of Wetiko and Pushbackers ever more\\ninﬂuenced by The Field of a far higher vibration beyond the\\nsimulation. Wetiko can’t invade the heart which is where most\\nlockdown opponents are coming from. It’s the heart that allows them\\nto see through the lies to the truth in ways I will be highlighting.\\nRenegade Minds know that calmness is the place from which\\nwisdom comes. You won’t ﬁnd wisdom in a hissing ﬁt and wisdom\\nis what we need in abundance right now. Calmness is not weakness\\n– you don’t have to scream at the top of your voice to be strong.\\nCalmness is indeed a sign of strength. ‘No’ means I’m not doing it.\\nNOOOO!!! doesn’t mean you’re not doing it even more. Volume\\ndoes not advance ‘No – I’m not doing it’. You are just not doing it.\\nWetiko possessed and inﬂuenced don’t know how to deal with that.\\nWetiko wants a ﬁght and we should not give it one. What it needs\\nmore than anything is our cooperation and we should not give that\\neither. Mass rallies and marches are great in that they are a visual\\nrepresentation of feeling, but if it ends there they are irrelevant. You\\ndemand that Wetikos act diﬀerently? Well, they’re not going to are\\nthey? They are Wetikos. We don’t need to waste our time demanding\\nthat something doesn’t happen when that will make no diﬀerence.\\nWe need to delete the means that allows it to happen. This, invariably,\\nis our cooperation. You can demand a child stop ﬁring a peashooter\\nat the dog or you can refuse to buy the peashooter. If you provide\\nthe means you are cooperating with the dog being smacked on the\\nnose with a pea. How can the authorities enforce mask-wearing if\\nmillions in a country refuse? What if the 74 million Pushbackers that\\nvoted for Trump in 2020 refused to wear masks, close their\\nbusinesses or stay in their homes. It would be unenforceable. The few control the many through the compliance of the many and that’s\\nalways been the dynamic be it ‘Covid’ regulations or the Roman\\nEmpire. I know people can ﬁnd it intimidating to say no to authority\\nor stand out in a crowd for being the only one with a face on display;\\nbut it has to be done or it’s over. I hope I’ve made clear in this book\\nthat where this is going will be far more intimidating than standing\\nup now and saying ‘No’ – I will not cooperate with my own\\nenslavement and that of my children. There might be consequences\\nfor some initially, although not so if enough do the same. The\\nquestion that must be addressed is what is going to happen if we\\ndon’t? It is time to be strong and unyieldingly so. No means no. Not\\nhere and there, but everywhere and always. I have refused to wear a\\nmask and obey all the other nonsense. I will not comply with\\ntyranny. I repeat: Fascism is not imposed by fascists – there are never\\nenough of them. Fascism is imposed by the population acquiescing\\nto fascism. I will not do it. I will die ﬁrst, or my body will. Living\\nmeekly under fascism is a form of death anyway, the death of the\\nspirit that Martin Luther King described.\\nMaking things happen\\nWe must not despair. This is not over till it’s over and it’s far from\\nthat. The ‘fat lady’ must refuse to sing. The longer the ‘Covid’ hoax\\nhas dragged on and impacted on more lives we have seen an\\nawakening of phenomenal numbers of people worldwide to the\\nrealisation that what they have believed all their lives is not how the\\nworld really is. Research published by the system-serving University\\nof Bristol and King’s College London in February, 2021, concluded:\\n‘One in every 11 people in Britain say they trust David Icke’s take on\\nthe coronavirus pandemic.’ It will be more by now and we have\\ngathering numbers to build on. We must urgently progress from\\nseeing the scam to ceasing to cooperate with it. Prominent German\\nlawyer Reiner Fuellmich, also licenced to practice law in America, is\\ndoing a magniﬁcent job taking the legal route to bring the\\npsychopaths to justice through a second Nuremberg tribunal for\\ncrimes against humanity. Fuellmich has an impressive record of beating the elite in court and he formed the German Corona\\nInvestigative Commi\\x00ee to pursue civil charges against the main\\nperpetrators with a view to triggering criminal charges. Most\\nimportantly he has grasped the foundation of the hoax – the PCR\\ntest not testing for the ‘virus’ – and Christian Drosten is therefore on\\nhis charge sheet along with Gates frontman Tedros at the World\\nHealth Organization. Major players must be not be allowed to inﬂict\\ntheir horrors on the human race without being brought to book. A\\nlife sentence must follow for Bill Gates and the rest of them. A group\\nof researchers has also indicted the government of Norway for\\ncrimes against humanity with copies sent to the police and the\\nInternational Criminal Court. The lawsuit cites participation in an\\ninternationally-planned false pandemic and violation of\\ninternational law and human rights, the European Commission’s\\ndeﬁnition of human rights by coercive rules, Nuremberg and Hague\\nrules on fundamental human rights, and the Norwegian\\nconstitution. We must take the initiative from hereon and not just\\ncomplain, protest and react.\\nThere are practical ways to support vital mass non-cooperation.\\nOrganising in numbers is one. Lockdown marches in London in the\\nspring in 2021 were mass non-cooperation that the authorities could\\nnot stop. There were too many people. Hundreds of thousands\\nwalked the London streets in the centre of the road for mile a\\x00er\\nmile while the Face-Nappies could only look on. They were\\ndetermined, but calm, and just did it with no histrionics and lots of\\nsmiles. The police were impotent. Others are organising group\\nshopping without masks for mutual support and imagine if that was\\nhappening all over. Policing it would be impossible. If the store\\nrefuses to serve people in these circumstances they would be faced\\nwith a long line of trolleys full of goods standing on their own and\\neverything would have to be returned to the shelves. How would\\nthey cope with that if it kept happening? I am talking here about\\nmoving on from complaining to being pro-active; from watching\\nthings happen to making things happen. I include in this our\\nrelationship with the police. The behaviour of many Face-Nappies •\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nhas been disgraceful and anyone who thinks they would never ﬁnd\\nconcentration camp guards in the ‘enlightened’ modern era have\\nhad that myth busted big-time. The period and se\\x00ing may change –\\nWetikos never do. I watched ﬁlm footage from a London march in\\nwhich a police thug viciously kicked a protestor on the ﬂoor who\\nhad done nothing. His fellow Face-Nappies stood in a ring\\nprotecting him. What he did was a criminal assault and with a\\ncrowd far outnumbering the police this can no longer be allowed to\\nhappen unchallenged. I get it when people chant ‘shame on you’ in\\nthese circumstances, but that is no longer enough. They have no\\nshame those who do this. Crowds needs to start making a citizen’s\\narrest of the police who commit criminal oﬀences and brutally a\\x00ack\\ninnocent people and defenceless women. A citizen’s arrest can be\\nmade under section 24A of the UK Police and Criminal Evidence\\n(PACE) Act of 1984 and you will ﬁnd something similar in other\\ncountries. I prefer to call it a Common Law arrest rather than\\ncitizen’s for reasons I will come to shortly. Anyone can arrest a\\nperson commi\\x00ing an indictable oﬀence or if they have reasonable\\ngrounds to suspect they are commi\\x00ing an indictable oﬀence. On\\nboth counts the a\\x00ack by the police thug would have fallen into this\\ncategory. A citizen’s arrest can be made to stop someone:\\n \\nCausing physical injury to himself or any other person\\nSuﬀering physical injury\\nCausing loss of or damage to property\\nMaking oﬀ before a constable can assume responsibility for him\\n \\nA citizen’s arrest may also be made to prevent a breach of the\\npeace under Common Law and if they believe a breach of the peace\\nwill happen or anything related to harm likely to be done or already\\ndone in their presence. This is the way to go I think – the Common\\nLaw version. If police know that the crowd and members of the\\npublic will no longer be standing and watching while they commit their thuggery and crimes they will think twice about acting like\\nBrownshirts and Blackshirts.\\nCommon Law – common sense\\nMention of Common Law is very important. Most people think the\\nlaw is the law as in one law. This is not the case. There are two\\nbodies of law, Common Law and Statute Law, and they are not the\\nsame. Common Law is founded on the simple premise of do no\\nharm. It does not recognise victimless crimes in which no harm is\\ndone while Statute Law does. There is a Statute Law against almost\\neverything. So what is Statute Law? Amazingly it’s the law of the sea\\nthat was brought ashore by the Cult to override the law of the land\\nwhich is Common Law. They had no right to do this and as always\\nthey did it anyway. They had to. They could not impose their will on\\nthe people through Common Law which only applies to do no harm.\\nHow could you stitch up the ﬁne detail of people’s lives with that?\\nInstead they took the law of the sea, or Admiralty Law, and applied\\nit to the population. Statute Law refers to all the laws spewing out of\\ngovernments and their agencies including all the fascist laws and\\nregulations relating to ‘Covid’. The key point to make is that Statute\\nLaw is contract law. It only applies between contracting corporations.\\nMost police oﬃcers don’t even know this. They have to be kept in\\nthe dark, too. Long ago when merchants and their sailing ships\\nbegan to trade with diﬀerent countries a contractual law was\\ndeveloped called Admiralty Law and other names. Again it only\\napplied to contracts agreed between corporate entities. If there is no\\nagreed contract the law of the sea had no jurisdiction and that still\\napplies to its new alias of Statute Law. The problem for the Cult when\\nthe law of the sea was brought ashore was an obvious one. People\\nwere not corporations and neither were government entities. To\\novercome the la\\x00er they made governments and all associated\\norganisations corporations. All the institutions are private\\ncorporations and I mean governments and their agencies, local\\ncouncils, police, courts, military, US states, the whole lot. Go to the Dun and Bradstreet corporate listings website for conﬁrmation that\\nthey are all corporations. You are arrested by a private corporation\\ncalled the police by someone who is really a private security guard\\nand they take you to court which is another private corporation.\\nNeither have jurisdiction over you unless you consent and contract\\nwith them. This is why you hear the mantra about law enforcement\\npolicing by consent of the people. In truth the people ‘consent’ only\\nin theory through monumental trickery.\\nOkay, the Cult overcame the corporate law problem by making\\ngovernments and institutions corporate entities; but what about\\npeople? They are not corporations are they? Ah ... well in a sense,\\nand only a sense, they are. Not people exactly – the illusion of\\npeople. The Cult creates a corporation in the name of everyone at the\\ntime that their birth certiﬁcate is issued. Note birth/ berth certiﬁcate\\nand when you go to court under the law of the sea on land you stand\\nin a dock. These are throwbacks to the origin. My Common Law\\nname is David Vaughan Icke. The name of the corporation created\\nby the government when I was born is called Mr David Vaughan\\nIcke usually wri\\x00en in capitals as MR DAVID VAUGHAN ICKE.\\nThat is not me, the living, breathing man. It is a ﬁctitious corporate\\nentity. The trick is to make you think that David Vaughan Icke and\\nMR DAVID VAUGHAN ICKE are the same thing. They are not. When\\npolice charge you and take you to court they are prosecuting the\\ncorporate entity and not the living, breathing, man or woman. They\\nhave to trick you into identifying as the corporate entity and\\ncontracting with them. Otherwise they have no jurisdiction. They do\\nthis through a language known as legalese. Lawful and legal are not\\nthe same either. Lawful relates to Common Law and legal relates to\\nStatute Law. Legalese is the language of Statue Law which uses\\nterms that mean one thing to the public and another in legalese.\\nNotice that when a police oﬃcer tells someone why they are being\\ncharged he or she will say at the end: ‘Do you understand?’ To the\\npublic that means ‘Do you comprehend?’ In legalese it means ‘Do\\nyou stand under me?’ Do you stand under my authority? If you say yes to the question you are unknowingly agreeing to give them\\njurisdiction over you in a contract between two corporate entities.\\nThis is a conﬁdence trick in every way. Contracts have to be agreed\\nbetween informed parties and if you don’t know that David\\nVaughan Icke is agreeing to be the corporation MR DAVID\\nVAUGHAN ICKE you cannot knowingly agree to contract. They are\\ndeceiving you and another way they do this is to ask for proof of\\nidentity. You usually show them a driving licence or other document\\non which your corporate name is wri\\x00en. In doing so you are\\naccepting that you are that corporate entity when you are not.\\nReferring to yourself as a ‘person’ or ‘citizen’ is also identifying with\\nyour corporate ﬁction which is why I made the Common Law point\\nabout the citizen’s arrest. If you are approached by a police oﬃcer\\nyou identify yourself immediately as a living, breathing, man or\\nwoman and say ‘I do not consent, I do not contract with you and I do\\nnot understand’ or stand under their authority. I have a Common\\nLaw birth certiﬁcate as a living man and these are available at no\\ncharge from commonlawcourt.com. Businesses registered under the\\nStatute Law system means that its laws apply. There are, however,\\nways to run a business under Common Law. Remember all ‘Covid’\\nlaws and regulations are Statute Law – the law of contracts and you\\ndo not have to contract. This doesn’t mean that you can kill someone\\nand get away with it. Common Law says do no harm and that\\napplies to physical harm, ﬁnancial harm etc. Police are employees of\\nprivate corporations and there needs to be a new system of non-\\ncorporate Common Law constables operating outside the Statute\\nLaw system. If you go to davidicke.com and put Common Law into\\nthe search engine you will ﬁnd videos that explain Common Law in\\nmuch greater detail. It is deﬁnitely a road we should walk.\\nWith all my heart\\nI have heard people say that we are in a spiritual war. I don’t like the\\nterm ‘war’ with its Wetiko dynamic, but I know what they mean.\\nSweep aside all the bodily forms and we are in a situation in which\\ntwo states of consciousness are seeking very diﬀerent realities. Wetiko wants upheaval, chaos, fear, suﬀering, conﬂict and control.\\nThe other wants love, peace, harmony, fairness and freedom. That’s\\nwhere we are. We should not fall for the idea that Wetiko is all-\\npowerful and there’s nothing we can do. Wetiko is not all-powerful.\\nIt’s a joke, pathetic. It doesn’t have to be, but it has made that choice\\nfor now. A handful of times over the years when I have felt the\\npresence of its frequency I have allowed it to a\\x00ach brieﬂy so I could\\nconsciously observe its nature. The experience is not pleasant, the\\nenergy is heavy and dark, but the ease with which you can kick it\\nback out the door shows that its real power is in persuading us that\\nit has power. It’s all a con. Wetiko is a con. It’s a trickster and not a\\npower that can control us if we unleash our own. The con is founded\\non manipulating humanity to give its power to Wetiko which\\nrecycles it back to present the illusion that it has power when its\\npower is ours that we gave away. This happens on an energetic level\\nand plays out in the world of the seen as humanity giving its power\\nto Wetiko authority which uses that power to control the population\\nwhen the power is only the power the population has handed over.\\nHow could it be any other way for billions to be controlled by a\\nrelative few? I have had experiences with people possessed by\\nWetiko and again you can kick its arse if you do it with an open\\nheart. Oh yes – the heart which can transform the world of perceived\\n‘ma\\x00er’.\\nWe are receiver-transmi\\x00ers and processors of information, but\\nwhat information and where from? Information is processed into\\nperception in three main areas – the brain, the heart and the belly.\\nThese relate to thinking, knowing, and emotion. Wetiko wants us to\\nbe head and belly people which means we think within the conﬁnes\\nof the Matrix simulation and low-vibrational emotional reaction\\nscrambles balance and perception. A few minutes on social media\\nand you see how emotion is the dominant force. Woke is all emotion\\nand is therefore thought-free and fact-free. Our heart is something\\ndiﬀerent. It knows while the head thinks and has to try to work it out\\nbecause it doesn’t know. The human energy ﬁeld has seven prime\\nvortexes which connect us with wider reality (Fig 23). Chakra means ‘wheels of light’ in the Sanskrit language of ancient India. The main\\nones are: The crown chakra on top of the head; brow (or ‘third eye’)\\nchakra in the centre of the forehead; throat chakra; heart chakra in\\nthe centre of the chest; solar plexus chakra below the sternum; sacral\\nchakra beneath the navel; and base chakra at the bo\\x00om of the spine.\\nEach one has a particular function or functions. We feel anxiety and\\nnervousness in the belly where the sacral chakra is located and this\\nprocesses emotion that can aﬀect the colon to give people ‘the shits’\\nor make them ‘shit scared’ when they are nervous. Chakras all play\\nan important role, but the Mr and Mrs Big is the heart chakra which\\nsits at the centre of the seven, above the chakras that connect us to\\nthe ‘physical’ and below those that connect with higher realms (or at\\nleast should). Here in the heart chakra we feel love, empathy and\\ncompassion – ‘My heart goes out to you’. Those with closed hearts\\nbecome literally ‘heart-less’ in their a\\x00itudes and behaviour (see Bill\\nGates). Native Americans portrayed Wetiko with what Paul Levy\\ncalls a ‘frigid, icy heart, devoid of mercy’ (see Bill Gates).\\nFigure 23: The chakra system which interpenetrates the human energy field. The heart chakra\\nis the governor – or should be.\\nWetiko trembles at the thought of heart energy which it cannot\\ninﬁltrate. The frequency is too high. What it seeks to do instead is\\nclose the heart chakra vortex to block its perceptual and energetic\\ninﬂuence. Psychopaths have ‘hearts of stone’ and emotionally-\\ndamaged people have ‘heartache’ and ‘broken hearts’. The\\nastonishing amount of heart disease is related to heart chakra disruption with its fundamental connection to the ‘physical’ heart.\\nDr Tom Cowan has wri\\x00en an outstanding book challenging the\\nbelief that the heart is a pump and making the connection between\\nthe ‘physical’ and spiritual heart. Rudolph Steiner who was way\\nahead of his time said the same about the fallacy that the heart is a\\npump. What? The heart is not a pump? That’s crazy, right?\\nEverybody knows that. Read Cowan’s Human Heart, Cosmic Heart\\nand you will realise that the very idea of the heart as a pump is\\nridiculous when you see the evidence. How does blood in the feet so\\nfar from the heart get pumped horizontally up the body by the\\nheart?? Cowan explains in the book the real reason why blood\\nmoves as it does. Our ‘physical’ heart is used to symbolise love when\\nthe source is really the heart vortex or spiritual heart which is our\\nmost powerful energetic connection to ‘out there’ expanded\\nconsciousness. That’s why we feel knowing – intuitive knowing – in\\nthe centre of the chest. Knowing doesn’t come from a process of\\nthoughts leading to a conclusion. It is there in an instant all in one\\ngo. Our heart knows because of its connection to levels of awareness\\nthat do know. This is the meaning and source of intuition – intuitive\\nknowing.\\nFor the last more than 30 years of uncovering the global game and\\nthe nature of reality my heart has been my constant antenna for\\ntruth and accuracy. An American intelligence insider once said that I\\nhad quoted a disinformer in one of my books and yet I had only\\nquoted the part that was true. He asked: ‘How do you do that?’ By\\nusing my heart antenna was the answer and anyone can do it. Heart-\\ncentred is how we are meant to be. With a closed heart chakra we\\nwithdraw into a closed mind and the bubble of ﬁve-sense reality. If\\nyou take a moment to focus your a\\x00ention on the centre of your\\nchest, picture a spinning wheel of light and see it opening and\\nexpanding. You will feel it happening, too, and perceptions of the\\nheart like joy and love as the heart impacts on the mind as they\\ninteract. The more the chakra opens the more you will feel\\nexpressions of heart consciousness and as the process continues, and\\nbecomes part of you, insights and knowings will follow. An open heart is connected to that level of awareness that knows all is One.\\nYou will see from its perspective that the fault-lines that divide us\\nare only illusions to control us. An open heart does not process the\\nillusions of race, creed and sexuality except as brief experiences for a\\nconsciousness that is all. Our heart does not see division, only unity\\n(Figs 24 and 25). There’s something else, too. Our hearts love to\\nlaugh. Mark Twain’s quote that says ‘The human race has one really\\neﬀective weapon, and that is laughter’ is really a reference to the\\nheart which loves to laugh with the joy of knowing the true nature of\\ninﬁnite reality and that all the madness of human society is an\\nillusion of the mind. Twain also said: ‘Against the assault of laughter\\nnothing can stand.’ This is so true of Wetiko and the Cult. Their\\ninsecurity demands that they be taken seriously and their power and\\nauthority acknowledged and feared. We should do nothing of the\\nsort. We should not get aggressive or fearful which their insecurity\\nso desires. We should laugh in their face. Even in their no-face as\\npolice come over in their face-nappies and expect to be taken\\nseriously. They don’t take themselves seriously looking like that so\\nwhy should we? Laugh in the face of intimidation. Laugh in the face\\nof tyranny. You will see by its reaction that you have pressed all of its\\nbu\\x00ons. Wetiko does not know what to do in the face of laughter or\\nwhen its targets refuse to concede their joy to fear. We have seen\\nmany examples during the ‘Covid’ hoax when people have\\nexpressed their energetic power and the string puppets of Wetiko\\nretreat with their tail limp between their knees. Laugh – the world is\\nbloody mad a\\x00er all and if it’s a choice between laughter and tears I\\nknow which way I’m going. Figure 24: Head consciousness without the heart sees division and everything apart from\\neverything else.\\nFigure 25: Heart consciousness sees everything as One.\\n‘Vaccines’ and the soul\\nThe foundation of Wetiko/Archon control of humans is the\\nseparation of incarnate ﬁve-sense mind from the inﬁnite ‘I’ and\\nclosing the heart chakra where the True ‘I’ lives during a human life.\\nThe goal has been to achieve complete separation in both cases. I was\\ninterested therefore to read an account by a French energetic healer\\nof what she said she experienced with a patient who had been given\\nthe ‘Covid’ vaccine. Genuine energy healers can sense information\\nand consciousness ﬁelds at diﬀerent levels of being which are\\nreferred to as ‘subtle bodies’. She described treating the patient who\\nlater returned a\\x00er having, without the healer’s knowledge, two\\ndoses of the ‘Covid vaccine’. The healer said:\\nI noticed immediately the change, very heavy energy emanating from [the] subtle bodies. The\\nscariest thing was when I was working on the heart chakra, I connected with her soul: it was\\ndetached from the physical body, it had no contact and it was, as if it was floating in a state of\\ntotal confusion: a damage to the consciousness that loses contact with the physical body, i.e.\\nwith our biological machine, there is no longer any communication between them.\\nI continued the treatment by sending light to the heart chakra, the soul of the person, but it\\nseemed that the soul could no longer receive any light, frequency or energy. It was a very\\npowerful experience for me. Then I understood that this substance is indeed used to detach\\nconsciousness so that this consciousness can no longer interact through this body that it\\npossesses in life, where there is no longer any contact, no frequency, no light, no more\\nenergetic balance or mind. This would create a human that is rudderless and at the extreme\\nalmost zombie-like operating with a fractional state of consciousness\\nat the mercy of Wetiko. I was especially intrigued by what the healer\\nsaid in the light of the prediction by the highly-informed Rudolf\\nSteiner more than a hundred years ago. He said:\\nIn the future, we will eliminate the soul with medicine. Under the pretext of a ‘healthy point\\nof view’, there will be a vaccine by which the human body will be treated as soon as possible\\ndirectly at birth, so that the human being cannot develop the thought of the existence of soul\\nand Spirit. To materialistic doctors will be entrusted the task of removing the soul of humanity.\\nAs today, people are vaccinated against this disease or that disease, so in the future, children\\nwill be vaccinated with a substance that can be produced precisely in such a way that people,\\nthanks to this vaccination, will be immune to being subjected to the ‘madness’ of spiritual life.\\nHe would be extremely smart, but he would not develop a conscience, and that is the true\\ngoal of some materialistic circles.\\nSteiner said the vaccine would detach the physical body from the\\netheric body (subtle bodies) and ‘once the etheric body is detached\\nthe relationship between the universe and the etheric body would\\nbecome extremely unstable, and man would become an automaton’.\\nHe said ‘the physical body of man must be polished on this Earth by\\nspiritual will – so the vaccine becomes a kind of arymanique\\n(Wetiko) force’ and ‘man can no longer get rid of a given\\nmaterialistic feeling’. Humans would then, he said, become\\n‘materialistic of constitution and can no longer rise to the spiritual’. I\\nhave been writing for years about DNA being a receiver-transmi\\x00er\\nof information that connects us to other levels of reality and these\\n‘vaccines’ changing DNA can be likened to changing an antenna and\\nwhat it can transmit and receive. Such a disconnection would clearly\\nlead to changes in personality and perception. Steiner further\\npredicted the arrival of AI. Big Pharma ‘Covid vaccine’ makers,\\nexpressions of Wetiko, are testing their DNA-manipulating evil on\\nchildren as I write with a view to giving the ‘vaccine’ to babies. If it’s\\na soul-body disconnector – and I say that it is or can be – every child\\nwould be disconnected from ‘soul’ at birth and the ‘vaccine’ would\\ncreate a closed system in which spiritual guidance from the greater\\nself would play no part. This has been the ambition of Wetiko all along. A Pentagon video from 2005 was leaked of a presentation\\nexplaining the development of vaccines to change behaviour by their\\neﬀect on the brain. Those that believe this is not happening with the\\n‘Covid’ genetically-modifying procedure masquerading as a\\n‘vaccine’ should make an urgent appointment with Naivety\\nAnonymous. Klaus Schwab wrote in 2018:\\nNeurotechnologies enable us to better influence consciousness and thought and to understand\\nmany activities of the brain. They include decoding what we are thinking in fine levels of\\ndetail through new chemicals and interventions that can influence our brains to correct for\\nerrors or enhance functionality.\\nThe plan is clear and only the heart can stop it. With every heart that\\nopens, every mind that awakens, Wetiko is weakened. Heart and\\nlove are far more powerful than head and hate and so nothing like a\\nmajority is needed to turn this around.\\nBeyond the Phantom\\nOur heart is the prime target of Wetiko and so it must be the answer\\nto Wetiko. We are our heart which is part of one heart, the inﬁnite\\nheart. Our heart is where the true self lives in a human life behind\\nﬁrewalls of ﬁve-sense illusion when an imposter takes its place –\\nPhantom Self; but our heart waits patiently to be set free any time we\\nchoose to see beyond the Phantom, beyond Wetiko. A Wetikoed\\nPhantom Self can wreak mass death and destruction while the love\\nof forever is locked away in its heart. The time is here to unleash its\\npower and let it sweep away the fear and despair that is Wetiko.\\nHeart consciousness does not seek manipulated, censored,\\nadvantage for its belief or religion, its activism and desires. As an\\nexpression of the One it treats all as One with the same rights to\\nfreedom and opinion. Our heart demands fairness for itself no more\\nthan for others. From this unity of heart we can come together in\\nmutual support and transform this Wetikoed world into what reality\\nis meant to be – a place of love, joy, happiness, fairness, justice and\\nfreedom. Wetiko has another agenda and that’s why the world is as it is, but enough of this nonsense. Wetiko can’t stay where hearts are\\nopen and it works so hard to keep them closed. Fear is its currency\\nand its food source and love in its true sense has no fear. Why would\\nlove have fear when it knows it is All That Is, Has Been, And Ever Can\\nBe on an eternal exploration of all possibility? Love in this true sense\\nis not the physical a\\x00raction that passes for love. This can be an\\nexpression of it, yes, but Inﬁnite Love, a love without condition, goes\\nfar deeper to the core of all being. It is the core of all being. Inﬁnite\\nrealty was born from love beyond the illusions of the simulation.\\nLove inﬁnitely expressed is the knowing that all is One and the\\nswi\\x00ly-passing experience of separation is a temporary\\nhallucination. You cannot disconnect from Oneness; you can only\\nperceive that you have and withdraw from its inﬂuence. This is the\\nmost important of all perception trickery by the mind parasite that is\\nWetiko and the foundation of all its potential for manipulation.\\nIf we open our hearts, open the sluice gates of the mind, and\\nredeﬁne self-identity amazing things start to happen. Consciousness\\nexpands or contracts in accordance with self-identity. When true self\\nis recognised as inﬁnite awareness and label self – Phantom Self – is\\nseen as only a series of brief experiences life is transformed.\\nConsciousness expands to the extent that self-identity expands and\\neverything changes. You see unity, not division, the picture, not the\\npixels. From this we can play the long game. No more is an\\nexperience something in and of itself, but a ﬂeeting moment in the\\neternity of forever. Suddenly people in uniform and dark suits are no\\nlonger intimidating. Doing what your heart knows to be right is no\\nlonger intimidating and consequences for those actions take on the\\nsame nature of a brief experience that passes in the blink of an\\ninﬁnite eye. Intimidation is all in the mind. Beyond the mind there is\\nno intimidation.\\nAn open heart does not consider consequences for what it knows\\nto be right. To do so would be to consider not doing what it knows to\\nbe right and for a heart in its power that is never an option. The\\nRenegade Mind is really the Renegade Heart. Consideration of\\nconsequences will always provide a getaway car for the mind and the heart doesn’t want one. What is right in the light of what we face\\ntoday is to stop cooperating with Wetiko in all its forms and to do it\\nwithout fear or compromise. You cannot compromise with tyranny\\nwhen tyranny always demands more until it has everything. Life is\\nyour perception and you are your destiny. Change your perception\\nand you change your life. Change collective perception and we\\nchange the world.\\nCome on people … One human family, One heart, One goal …\\nFREEEEEEDOM!\\nWe must se\\x00le for nothing less. T\\nPostscript\\nhe big scare story as the book goes to press is the ‘Indian’\\nvariant and the world is being deluged with propaganda about\\nthe ‘Covid catastrophe’ in India which mirrors in its lies and\\nmisrepresentations what happened in Italy before the ﬁrst lockdown\\nin 2020.\\nThe New York Post published a picture of someone who had\\n‘collapsed in the street from Covid’ in India in April, 2021, which\\nwas actually taken during a gas leak in May, 2020. Same old, same\\nold. Media articles in mid-February were asking why India had been\\nso untouched by ‘Covid’ and then as their vaccine rollout gathered\\npace the alleged ‘cases’ began to rapidly increase. Indian ‘Covid\\nvaccine’ maker Bharat Biotech was funded into existence by the Bill\\nand Melinda Gates Foundation (the pair announced their divorce in\\nMay, 2021, which is a pity because they so deserve each other). The\\nIndian ‘Covid crisis’ was ramped up by the media to terrify the\\nworld and prepare people for submission to still more restrictions.\\nThe scam that worked the ﬁrst time was being repeated only with far\\nmore people seeing through the deceit. Davidicke.com and\\nIckonic.com have sought to tell the true story of what is happening\\nby talking to people living through the Indian nightmare which has\\nnothing to do with ‘Covid’. We posted a le\\x00er from ‘Alisha’ in Pune\\nwho told a very diﬀerent story to government and media mendacity.\\nShe said scenes of dying people and overwhelmed hospitals were\\ndesigned to hide what was really happening – genocide and\\nstarvation. Alisha said that millions had already died of starvation\\nduring the ongoing lockdowns while government and media were\\nlying and making it look like the ‘virus’: Restaurants, shops, gyms, theatres, basically everything is shut. The cities are ghost towns.\\nEven so-called ‘essential’ businesses are only open till 11am in the morning. You basically\\nhave just an hour to buy food and then your time is up.\\nInter-state travel and even inter-district travel is banned. The cops wait at all major crossroads\\nto question why you are traveling outdoors or to fine you if you are not wearing a mask.\\nThe medical community here is also complicit in genocide, lying about hospitals being full\\nand turning away people with genuine illnesses, who need immediate care. They have even\\ncreated a shortage of oxygen cylinders.\\nThis is the classic Cult modus operandi played out in every country.\\nAlisha said that people who would not have a PCR test not testing\\nfor the ‘virus’ were being denied hospital treatment. She said the\\npeople hit hardest were migrant workers and those in rural areas.\\nMost businesses employed migrant workers and with everything\\nclosed there were no jobs, no income and no food. As a result\\nmillions were dying of starvation or malnutrition. All this was\\nhappening under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a 100-percent\\nasset of the Cult, and it emphasises yet again the scale of pure anti-\\nhuman evil we are dealing with. Australia banned its people from\\nreturning home from India with penalties for trying to do so of up to\\nﬁve years in jail and a ﬁne of £37,000. The manufactured ‘Covid’\\ncrisis in India was being prepared to justify further fascism in the\\nWest. Obvious connections could be seen between the Indian\\n‘vaccine’ programme and increased ‘cases’ and this became a\\ncommon theme. The Seychelles, the most per capita ‘Covid\\nvaccinated’ population in the world, went back into lockdown a\\x00er a\\n‘surge of cases’.\\nLong ago the truly evil Monsanto agricultural biotechnology\\ncorporation with its big connections to Bill Gates devastated Indian\\nfarming with genetically-modiﬁed crops. Human rights activist\\nGurcharan Singh highlighted the eﬀorts by the Indian government\\nto complete the job by destroying the food supply to hundreds of\\nmillions with ‘Covid’ lockdowns. He said that 415 million people at\\nthe bo\\x00om of the disgusting caste system (still going whatever they\\nsay) were below the poverty line and struggled to feed themselves\\nevery year. Now the government was imposing lockdown at just the time to destroy the harvest. This deliberate policy was leading to\\nmass starvation. People may reel back at the suggestion that a\\ngovernment would do that, but Wetiko-controlled ‘leaders’ are\\ncapable of any level of evil. In fact what is described in India is in the\\nprocess of being instigated worldwide. The food chain and food\\nsupply are being targeted at every level to cause world hunger and\\nthus control. Bill Gates is not the biggest owner of farmland in\\nAmerica for no reason and destroying access to food aids both the\\ndepopulation agenda and the plan for synthetic ‘food’ already being\\nfunded into existence by Gates. Add to this the coming hyper-\\ninﬂation from the suicidal creation of fake ‘money’ in response to\\n‘Covid’ and the breakdown of container shipping systems and you\\nhave a cocktail that can only lead one way and is meant to. The Cult\\nplan is to crash the entire system to ‘build back be\\x00er’ with the Great\\nReset.\\n‘Vaccine’ transmission\\nReports from all over the world continue to emerge of women\\nsuﬀering menstrual and fertility problems a\\x00er having the fake\\n‘vaccine’ and of the non-’vaccinated’ having similar problems when\\ninteracting with the ‘vaccinated’. There are far too many for\\n‘coincidence’ to be credible. We’ve had menopausal women ge\\x00ing\\nperiods, others having periods stop or not stopping for weeks,\\npassing clots, sometimes the lining of the uterus, breast\\nirregularities, and miscarriages (which increased by 400 percent in\\nparts of the United States). Non-‘vaccinated’ men and children have\\nsuﬀered blood clots and nose bleeding a\\x00er interaction with the\\n‘vaccinated’. Babies have died from the eﬀects of breast milk from a\\n‘vaccinated’ mother. Awake doctors – the small minority –\\nspeculated on the cause of non-’vaccinated’ suﬀering the same\\neﬀects as the ‘vaccinated’. Was it nanotechnology in the synthetic\\nsubstance transmi\\x00ing frequencies or was it a straight chemical\\nbioweapon that was being transmi\\x00ed between people? I am not\\nsaying that some kind of chemical transmission is not one possible\\nanswer, but the foundation of all that the Cult does is frequency and this is fertile ground for understanding how transmission can\\nhappen. American doctor Carrie Madej, an internal medicine\\nphysician and osteopath, has been practicing for the last 20 years,\\nteaching medical students, and she says a\\x00ending diﬀerent meetings\\nwhere the agenda for humanity was discussed. Madej, who operates\\nout of Georgia, did not dismiss other possible forms of transmission,\\nbut she focused on frequency in search of an explanation for\\ntransmission. She said the Moderna and Pﬁzer ‘vaccines’ contained\\nnano-lipid particles as a key component. This was a brand new\\ntechnology never before used on humanity. ‘They’re using a\\nnanotechnology which is pre\\x00y much li\\x00le tiny computer bits …\\nnanobots or hydrogel.’ Inside the ‘vaccines’ was ‘this sci-ﬁ kind of\\nsubstance’ which suppressed immune checkpoints to get into the\\ncell. I referred to this earlier as the ‘Trojan horse’ technique that\\ntricks the cell into opening a gateway for the self-replicating\\nsynthetic material and while the immune system is artiﬁcially\\nsuppressed the body has no defences. Madej said the substance\\nserved many purposes including an on-demand ability to ‘deliver\\nthe payload’ and using the nano ‘computer bits’ as biosensors in the\\nbody. ‘It actually has the ability to accumulate data from your body,\\nlike your breathing, your respiration, thoughts, emotions, all kinds\\nof things.’\\nShe said the technology obviously has the ability to operate\\nthrough Wi-Fi and transmit and receive energy, messages,\\nfrequencies or impulses. ‘Just imagine you’re ge\\x00ing this new\\nsubstance in you and it can react to things all around you, the 5G,\\nyour smart device, your phones.’ We had something completely\\nforeign in the human body that had never been launched large scale\\nat a time when we were seeing 5G going into schools and hospitals\\n(plus the Musk satellites) and she believed the ‘vaccine’ transmission\\nhad something to do with this: ‘… if these people have this inside of\\nthem … it can act like an antenna and actually transmit it outwardly\\nas well.’ The synthetic substance produced its own voltage and so it\\ncould have that kind of eﬀect. This ﬁts with my own contention that\\nthe nano receiver-transmi\\x00ers are designed to connect people to the Smart Grid and break the receiver-transmi\\x00er connection to\\nexpanded consciousness. That would explain the French energy\\nhealer’s experience of the disconnection of body from ‘soul’ with\\nthose who have had the ‘vaccine’. The nanobots, self-replicating\\ninside the body, would also transmit the synthetic frequency which\\ncould be picked up through close interaction by those who have not\\nbeen ‘vaccinated’. Madej speculated that perhaps it was 5G and\\nincreased levels of other radiation that was causing the symptoms\\ndirectly although interestingly she said that non-‘vaccinated’\\npatients had shown improvement when they were away from the\\n‘vaccinated’ person they had interacted with. It must be remembered\\nthat you can control frequency and energy with your mind and you\\ncan consciously create energetic barriers or bubbles with the mind to\\nstop damaging frequencies from penetrating your ﬁeld. American\\npaediatrician Dr Larry Palevsky said the ‘vaccine’ was not a ‘vaccine’\\nand was never designed to protect from a ‘viral’ infection. He called\\nit ‘a massive, brilliant propaganda of genocide’ because they didn’t\\nhave to inject everyone to get the result they wanted. He said the\\ncontent of the jabs was able to infuse any material into the brain,\\nheart, lungs, kidneys, liver, sperm and female productive system.\\n‘This is genocide; this is a weapon of mass destruction.’ At the same\\ntime American colleges were banning students from a\\x00ending if\\nthey didn’t have this life-changing and potentially life-ending\\n‘vaccine’. Class action lawsuits must follow when the consequences\\nof this college fascism come to light. As the book was going to press\\ncame reports about fertility eﬀects on sperm in ‘vaccinated’ men\\nwhich would absolutely ﬁt with what I have been saying and\\nhospitals continued to ﬁll with ‘vaccine’ reactions. Another question\\nis what about transmission via blood transfusions? The NHS has\\nextended blood donation restrictions from seven days a\\x00er a ‘Covid\\nvaccination’ to 28 days a\\x00er even a sore arm reaction.\\nI said in the spring of 2020 that the then touted ‘Covid vaccine’\\nwould be ongoing each year like the ﬂu jab. A year later Pﬁzer CEO,\\nthe appalling Albert Bourla, said people would ‘likely’ need a\\n‘booster dose’ of the ‘vaccine’ within 12 months of ge\\x00ing ‘fully vaccinated’ and then a yearly shot. ‘Variants will play a key role’, he\\nsaid conﬁrming the point. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky also\\ntook time out from his ‘vaccine’ disaster to say that people may need\\nto be vaccinated against ‘Covid-19’ each year. UK Health Secretary,\\nthe psychopath Ma\\x00 Hancock, said additional ‘boosters’ would be\\navailable in the autumn of 2021. This is the trap of the ‘vaccine\\npassport’. The public will have to accept every last ‘vaccine’ they\\nintroduce, including for the fake ‘variants’, or it would cease to be\\nvalid. The only other way in some cases would be continuous testing\\nwith a test not testing for the ‘virus’ and what is on the swabs\\nconstantly pushed up your noise towards the brain every time?\\n‘Vaccines’ changing behaviour\\nI mentioned in the body of the book how I believed we would see\\ngathering behaviour changes in the ‘vaccinated’ and I am already\\nhearing such comments from the non-‘vaccinated’ describing\\nbehaviour changes in friends, loved ones and work colleagues. This\\nwill only increase as the self-replicating synthetic material and\\nnanoparticles expand in body and brain. An article in the Guardian in\\n2016 detailed research at the University of Virginia in Charlo\\x00esville\\nwhich developed a new method for controlling brain circuits\\nassociated with complex animal behaviour. The method, dubbed\\n‘magnetogenetics’, involves genetically-engineering a protein called\\nferritin, which stores and releases iron, to create a magnetised\\nsubstance – ‘Magneto’ – that can activate speciﬁc groups of nerve\\ncells from a distance. This is claimed to be an advance on other\\nmethods of brain activity manipulation known as optogenetics and\\nchemogenetics (the Cult has been developing methods of brain\\ncontrol for a long time). The ferritin technique is said to be non-\\ninvasive and able to activate neurons ‘rapidly and reversibly’. In\\nother words, human thought and perception. The article said that\\nearlier studies revealed how nerve cell proteins ‘activated by heat\\nand mechanical pressure can be genetically engineered so that they\\nbecome sensitive to radio waves and magnetic ﬁelds, by a\\x00aching\\nthem to an iron-storing protein called ferritin, or to inorganic paramagnetic particles’. Sensitive to radio waves and magnetic\\nﬁelds? You mean like 5G, 6G and 7G? This is the human-AI Smart\\nGrid hive mind we are talking about. The Guardian article said:\\n… the researchers injected Magneto into the striatum of freely behaving mice, a deep brain\\nstructure containing dopamine-producing neurons that are involved in reward and motivation,\\nand then placed the animals into an apparatus split into magnetised and non-magnetised\\nsections.\\nMice expressing Magneto spent far more time in the magnetised areas than mice that did not,\\nbecause activation of the protein caused the striatal neurons expressing it to release\\ndopamine, so that the mice found being in those areas rewarding. This shows that Magneto\\ncan remotely control the firing of neurons deep within the brain, and also control complex\\nbehaviours.\\nMake no mistake this basic methodology will be part of the ‘Covid\\nvaccine’ cocktail and using magnetics to change brain function\\nthrough electromagnetic ﬁeld frequency activation. The Pentagon is\\ndeveloping a ‘Covid vaccine’ using ferritin. Magnetics would explain\\nchanges in behaviour and why videos are appearing across the\\nInternet as I write showing how magnets stick to the skin at the\\npoint of the ‘vaccine’ shot. Once people take these ‘vaccines’\\nanything becomes possible in terms of brain function and illness\\nwhich will be blamed on ‘Covid-19’ and ‘variants’. Magnetic ﬁeld\\nmanipulation would further explain why the non-‘vaccinated’ are\\nreporting the same symptoms as the ‘vaccinated’ they interact with\\nand why those symptoms are reported to decrease when not in their\\ncompany. Interestingly ‘Magneto’, a ‘mutant’, is a character in the\\nMarvel Comic X-Men stories with the ability to manipulate magnetic\\nﬁelds and he believes that mutants should ﬁght back against their\\nhuman oppressors by any means necessary. The character was born\\nErik Lehnsherr to a Jewish family in Germany.\\nCult-controlled courts\\nThe European Court of Human Rights opened the door for\\nmandatory ‘Covid-19 vaccines’ across the continent when it ruled in\\na Czech Republic dispute over childhood immunisation that legally enforced vaccination could be ‘necessary in a democratic society’.\\nThe 17 judges decided that compulsory vaccinations did not breach\\nhuman rights law. On the face of it the judgement was so inverted\\nyou gasp for air. If not having a vaccine infused into your body is not\\na human right then what is? Ah, but they said human rights law\\nwhich has been speciﬁcally wri\\x00en to delete all human rights at the\\nbehest of the state (the Cult). Article 8 of the European Convention\\non Human Rights relates to the right to a private life. The crucial\\nword here is ‘except’:\\nThere shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right EXCEPT\\nsuch as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests\\nof national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention\\nof disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights\\nand freedoms of others [My emphasis].\\nNo interference except in accordance with the law means there are no\\n‘human rights’ except what EU governments decide you can have at\\ntheir behest. ‘As is necessary in a democratic society’ explains that\\nreference in the judgement and ‘in the interests of national security,\\npublic safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the\\nprevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or\\nmorals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others’\\ngives the EU a coach and horses to ride through ‘human rights’ and\\nsca\\x00er them in all directions. The judiciary is not a check and\\nbalance on government extremism; it is a vehicle to enforce it. This\\njudgement was almost laughably predictable when the last thing the\\nCult wanted was a decision that went against mandatory\\nvaccination. Judges rule over and over again to beneﬁt the system of\\nwhich they are a part. Vaccination disputes that come before them\\nare invariably delivered in favour of doctors and authorities\\nrepresenting the view of the state which owns the judiciary. Oh, yes,\\nand we have even had calls to stop pu\\x00ing ‘Covid-19’ on death\\ncertiﬁcates within 28 days of a ‘positive test’ because it is claimed the\\npractice makes the ‘vaccine’ appear not to work. They are laughing\\nat you. The scale of madness, inhumanity and things to come was\\nhighlighted when those not ‘vaccinated’ for ‘Covid’ were refused\\nevacuation from the Caribbean island of St Vincent during massive\\nvolcanic eruptions. Cruise ships taking residents to the safety of\\nanother island allowed only the ‘vaccinated’ to board and the rest\\nwere le\\x00 to their fate. Even in life and death situations like this we\\nsee ‘Covid’ stripping people of their most basic human instincts and\\nthe insanity is even more extreme when you think that fake\\n‘vaccine’-makers are not even claiming their body-manipulating\\nconcoctions stop ‘infection’ and ‘transmission’ of a ‘virus’ that\\ndoesn’t exist. St Vincent Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said: ‘The\\nchief medical oﬃcer will be identifying the persons already\\nvaccinated so that we can get them on the ship.’ Note again the\\npower of the chief medical oﬃcer who, like Whi\\x00y in the UK, will be\\nanswering to the World Health Organization. This is the Cult\\nnetwork structure that has overridden politicians who ‘follow the\\nscience’ which means doing what WHO-controlled ‘medical oﬃcers’\\nand ‘science advisers’ tell them. Gonsalves even said that residents\\nwho were ‘vaccinated’ a\\x00er the order so they could board the ships\\nwould still be refused entry due to possible side eﬀects such as\\n‘wooziness in the head’. The good news is that if they were woozy\\nenough in the head they could qualify to be prime minister of St\\nVincent.\\nMicrochipping freedom\\nThe European judgement will be used at some point to justify moves\\nto enforce the ‘Covid’ DNA-manipulating procedure. Sandra Ro,\\nCEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council, told a World\\nEconomic Forum event that she hoped ‘vaccine passports’ would\\nhelp to ‘drive forced consent and standardisation’ of global digital\\nidentity schemes: ‘I’m hoping with the desire and global demand for\\nsome sort of vaccine passport – so that people can get travelling and\\nworking again – [it] will drive forced consent, standardisation, and\\nfrankly, cooperation across the world.’ The lady is either not very\\nbright, or thoroughly mendacious, to use the term ‘forced consent’. You do not ‘consent’ if you are forced – you submit. She was\\ndescribing what the plan has been all along and that’s to enforce a\\ndigital identity on every human without which they could not\\nfunction. ‘Vaccine passports’ are opening the door and are far from\\nthe end goal. A digital identity would allow you to be tracked in\\neverything you do in cyberspace and this is the same technique used\\nby Cult-owned China to enforce its social credit system of total\\ncontrol. The ultimate ‘passport’ is planned to be a microchip as my\\nbooks have warned for nearly 30 years. Those nice people at the\\nPentagon working for the Cult-controlled Defense Advanced\\nResearch Projects Agency (DARPA) claimed in April, 2021, they\\nhave developed a microchip inserted under the skin to detect\\n‘asymptomatic Covid-19 infection’ before it becomes an outbreak\\nand a ‘revolutionary ﬁlter’ that can remove the ‘virus’ from the\\nblood when a\\x00ached to a dialysis machine. The only problems with\\nthis are that the ‘virus’ does not exist and people transmi\\x00ing the\\n‘virus’ with no symptoms is brain-numbing bullshit. This is, of\\ncourse, not a ruse to get people to be microchipped for very diﬀerent\\nreasons. DARPA also said it was producing a one-stop ‘vaccine’ for\\nthe ‘virus’ and all ‘variants’. One of the most sinister organisations\\non Planet Earth is doing this? Be\\x00er have it then. These people are\\ninsane because Wetiko that possesses them is insane.\\nResearchers from the Salk Institute in California announced they\\nhave created an embryo that is part human and part monkey. My\\nbooks going back to the 1990s have exposed experiments in top\\nsecret underground facilities in the United States where humans are\\nbeing crossed with animal and non-human ‘extraterrestrial’ species.\\nThey are now easing that long-developed capability into the public\\narena and there is much more to come given we are dealing with\\npsychiatric basket cases. Talking of which – Elon Musk’s scientists at\\nNeuralink trained a monkey to play Pong and other puzzles on a\\ncomputer screen using a joystick and when the monkey made the\\ncorrect move a metal tube squirted banana smoothie into his mouth\\nwhich is the basic technique for training humans into unquestioning\\ncompliance. Two Neuralink chips were in the monkey’s skull and more than 2,000 wires ‘fanned out’ into its brain. Eventually the\\nmonkey played a video game purely with its brain waves.\\nPsychopathic narcissist Musk said the ‘breakthrough’ was a step\\ntowards pu\\x00ing Neuralink chips into human skulls and merging\\nminds with artiﬁcial intelligence. Exactly. This man is so dark and\\nCult to his DNA.\\nWorld Economic Fascism (WEF)\\nThe World Economic Forum is telling you the plan by the statements\\nmade at its many and various events. Cult-owned fascist YouTube\\nCEO Susan Wojcicki spoke at the 2021 WEF Global Technology\\nGovernance Summit (see the name) in which 40 governments and\\n150 companies met to ensure ‘the responsible design and\\ndeployment of emerging technologies’. Orwellian translation:\\n‘Ensuring the design and deployment of long-planned technologies\\nwill advance the Cult agenda for control and censorship.’ Freedom-\\ndestroyer and Nuremberg-bound Wojcicki expressed support for\\ntech platforms like hers to censor content that is ‘technically legal but\\ncould be harmful’. Who decides what is ‘harmful’? She does and\\nthey do. ‘Harmful’ will be whatever the Cult doesn’t want people to\\nsee and we have legislation proposed by the UK government that\\nwould censor content on the basis of ‘harm’ no ma\\x00er if the\\ninformation is fair, legal and provably true. Make that especially if it\\nis fair, legal and provably true. Wojcicki called for a global coalition\\nto be formed to enforce content moderation standards through\\nautomated censorship. This is a woman and mega-censor so self-\\ndeluded that she shamelessly accepted a ‘free expression’ award –\\nWojcicki – in an event sponsored by her own YouTube. They have no\\nshame and no self-awareness.\\nYou know that ‘Covid’ is a scam and Wojcicki a Cult operative\\nwhen YouTube is censoring medical and scientiﬁc opinion purely on\\nthe grounds of whether it supports or opposes the Cult ‘Covid’\\nnarrative. Florida governor Ron DeSantis compiled an expert panel\\nwith four professors of medicine from Harvard, Oxford, and\\nStanford Universities who spoke against forcing children and vaccinated people to wear masks. They also said there was no proof\\nthat lockdowns reduced spread or death rates of ‘Covid-19’. Cult-\\ngofer Wojcicki and her YouTube deleted the panel video ‘because it\\nincluded content that contradicts the consensus of local and global\\nhealth authorities regarding the eﬃcacy of masks to prevent the\\nspread of Covid-19’. This ‘consensus’ refers to what the Cult tells the\\nWorld Health Organization to say and the WHO tells ‘local health\\nauthorities’ to do. Wojcicki knows this, of course. The panellists\\npointed out that censorship of scientiﬁc debate was responsible for\\ndeaths from many causes, but Wojcicki couldn’t care less. She would\\nnot dare go against what she is told and as a disgrace to humanity\\nshe wouldn’t want to anyway. The UK government is seeking to pass\\na fascist ‘Online Safety Bill’ to speciﬁcally target with massive ﬁnes\\nand other means non-censored video and social media platforms to\\nmake them censor ‘lawful but harmful’ content like the Cult-owned\\nFacebook, Twi\\x00er, Google and YouTube. What is ‘lawful but\\nharmful’ would be decided by the fascist Blair-created Ofcom.\\nAnother WEF obsession is a cyber-a\\x00ack on the ﬁnancial system\\nand this is clearly what the Cult has planned to take down the bank\\naccounts of everyone – except theirs. Those that think they have\\nenough money for the Cult agenda not to ma\\x00er to them have got a\\nbig lesson coming if they continue to ignore what is staring them in\\nthe face. The World Economic Forum, funded by Gates and fronted\\nby Klaus Schwab, announced it would be running a ‘simulation’\\nwith the Russian government and global banks of just such an a\\x00ack\\ncalled Cyber Polygon 2021. What they simulate – as with the ‘Covid’\\nEvent 201 – they plan to instigate. The WEF is involved in a project\\nwith the Cult-owned Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\\ncalled the WEF-Carnegie Cyber Policy Initiative which seeks to\\nmerge Wall Street banks, ‘regulators’ (I love it) and intelligence\\nagencies to ‘prevent’ (arrange and allow) a cyber-a\\x00ack that would\\nbring down the global ﬁnancial system as long planned by those that\\ncontrol the WEF and the Carnegie operation. The Carnegie\\nEndowment for International Peace sent an instruction to First World War US President Woodrow Wilson not to let the war end before\\nsociety had been irreversibly transformed.\\nThe Wuhan lab diversion\\nAs I close, the Cult-controlled authorities and lapdog media are\\nsystematically pushing ‘the virus was released from the Wuhan lab’\\nnarrative. There are two versions – it happened by accident and it\\nhappened on purpose. Both are nonsense. The perceived existence of\\nthe never-shown-to-exist ‘virus’ is vital to sell the impression that\\nthere is actually an infective agent to deal with and to allow the\\nendless potential for terrifying the population with ‘variants’ of a\\n‘virus’ that does not exist. The authorities at the time of writing are\\ngoing with the ‘by accident’ while the alternative media is\\npromoting the ‘on purpose’. Cable news host Tucker Carlson who\\nhas questioned aspects of lockdown and ‘vaccine’ compulsion has\\nbought the Wuhan lab story. ‘Everyone now agrees’ he said. Well, I\\ndon’t and many others don’t and the question is why does the system\\nand its media suddenly ‘agree’? When the media moves as one unit\\nwith a narrative it is always a lie – witness the hour by hour\\nmendacity of the ‘Covid’ era. Why would this Cult-owned\\ncombination which has unleashed lies like machine gun ﬁre\\nsuddenly ‘agree’ to tell the truth??\\nMuch of the alternative media is buying the lie because it ﬁts the\\nconspiracy narrative, but it’s the wrong conspiracy. The real\\nconspiracy is that there is no virus and that is what the Cult is\\ndesperate to hide. The idea that the ‘virus’ was released by accident\\nis ludicrous when the whole ‘Covid’ hoax was clearly long-planned\\nand waiting to be played out as it was so fast in accordance with the\\nRockefeller document and Event 201. So they prepared everything in\\ndetail over decades and then sat around strumming their ﬁngers\\nwaiting for an ‘accidental’ release from a bio-lab? What?? It’s crazy.\\nThen there’s the ‘on purpose’ claim. You want to circulate a ‘deadly\\nvirus’ and hide the fact that you’ve done so and you release it down\\nthe street from the highest-level bio-lab in China? I repeat – What?? You would release it far from that lab to stop any association being\\nmade. But, no, we’ll do it in a place where the connection was certain\\nto be made. Why would you need to scam ‘cases’ and ‘deaths’ and\\npay hospitals to diagnose ‘Covid-19’ if you had a real ‘virus’? What\\nare sections of the alternative media doing believing this crap?\\nWhere were all the mass deaths in Wuhan from a ‘deadly pathogen’\\nwhen the recovery to normal life a\\x00er the initial propaganda was\\ndramatic in speed? Why isn’t the ‘deadly pathogen’ now circulating\\nall over China with bodies in the street? Once again we have the\\ntechnique of tell them what they want to hear and they will likely\\nbelieve it. The alternative media has its ‘conspiracy’ and with\\nCarlson it ﬁts with his ‘China is the danger’ narrative over years.\\nChina is a danger as a global Cult operations centre, but not for this\\nreason. The Wuhan lab story also has the potential to instigate\\nconﬂict with China when at some stage the plan is to trigger a\\nProblem-Reaction-Solution confrontation with the West. Question\\neverything – everything – and especially when the media agrees on a\\ncommon party line.\\nThird wave … fourth wave … fifth wave …\\nAs the book went into production the world was being set up for\\nmore lockdowns and a ‘third wave’ supported by invented ‘variants’\\nthat were increasing all the time and will continue to do so in public\\nstatements and computer programs, but not in reality. India became\\nthe new Italy in the ‘Covid’ propaganda campaign and we were told\\nto be frightened of the new ‘Indian strain’. Somehow I couldn’t ﬁnd\\nit within myself to do so. A document produced for the UK\\ngovernment entitled ‘Summary of further modelling of easing of\\nrestrictions – Roadmap Step 2’ declared that a third wave was\\ninevitable (of course when it’s in the script) and it would be the fault\\nof children and those who refuse the health-destroying fake ‘Covid\\nvaccine’. One of the computer models involved came from the Cult-\\nowned Imperial College and the other from Warwick University\\nwhich I wouldn’t trust to tell me the date in a calendar factory. The\\ndocument states that both models presumed extremely high uptake of the ‘Covid vaccines’ and didn’t allow for ‘variants’. The document\\nstates: ‘The resurgence is a result of some people (mostly children)\\nbeing ineligible for vaccination; others choosing not to receive the\\nvaccine; and others being vaccinated but not perfectly protected.’\\nThe mendacity takes the breath away. Okay, blame those with a\\nbrain who won’t take the DNA-modifying shots and put more\\npressure on children to have it as ‘trials’ were underway involving\\nchildren as young as six months with parents who give insanity a\\nbad name. Massive pressure is being put on the young to have the\\nfake ‘vaccine’ and child age consent limits have been systematically\\nlowered around the world to stop parents intervening. Most\\nextraordinary about the document was its claim that the ‘third wave’\\nwould be driven by ‘the resurgence in both hospitalisations and\\ndeaths … dominated by those that have received two doses of the vaccine,\\ncomprising around 60-70% of the wave respectively’. The predicted\\npeak of the ‘third wave’ suggested 300 deaths per day with 250 of\\nthem fully ‘vaccinated’ people. How many more lies do acquiescers\\nneed to be told before they see the obvious? Those who took the jab\\nto ‘protect themselves’ are projected to be those who mostly get sick\\nand die? So what’s in the ‘vaccine’? The document went on:\\nIt is possible that a summer of low prevalence could be followed by substantial increases in\\nincidence over the following autumn and winter. Low prevalence in late summer should not\\nbe taken as an indication that SARS-CoV-2 has retreated or that the population has high\\nenough levels of immunity to prevent another wave.\\nThey are telling you the script and while many British people\\nbelieved ‘Covid’ restrictions would end in the summer of 2021 the\\ngovernment was preparing for them to be ongoing. Authorities were\\nawarding contracts for ‘Covid marshals’ to police the restrictions\\nwith contracts starting in July, 2021, and going through to January\\n31st, 2022, and the government was advertising for ‘Media Buying\\nServices’ to secure media propaganda slots worth a potential £320\\nmillion for ‘Covid-19 campaigns’ with a contract not ending until\\nMarch, 2022. The recipient – via a list of other front companies – was\\nreported to be American media marketing giant Omnicom Group Inc. While money is no object for ‘Covid’ the UK waiting list for all\\nother treatment – including life-threatening conditions – passed 4.5\\nmillion. Meantime the Cult is seeking to control all oﬃcial ‘inquiries’\\nto block revelations about what has really been happening and why.\\nIt must not be allowed to – we need Nuremberg jury trials in every\\ncountry. The cover-up doesn’t get more obvious than appointing\\nultra-Zionist professor Philip Zelikow to oversee two dozen US\\nvirologists, public health oﬃcials, clinicians, former government\\noﬃcials and four American ‘charitable foundations’ to ‘learn the\\nlessons’ of the ‘Covid’ debacle. The personnel will be those that\\ncreated and perpetuated the ‘Covid’ lies while Zelikow is the former\\nexecutive director of the 9/11 Commission who ensured that the\\ntruth about those a\\x00acks never came out and produced a report that\\nmust be among the most mendacious and manipulative documents\\never wri\\x00en – see The Trigger for the detailed exposure of the almost\\nunimaginable 9/11 story in which Sabbatians can be found at every\\nlevel.\\nPassive no more\\nPeople are increasingly challenging the authorities with amazing\\nnumbers of people taking to the streets in London well beyond the\\nability of the Face-Nappies to stop them. Instead the Nappies choose\\nsituations away from the mass crowds to target, intimidate, and seek\\nto promote the impression of ‘violent protestors’. One such incident\\nhappened in London’s Hyde Park. Hundreds of thousands walking\\nthrough the streets in protest against ‘Covid’ fascism were ignored\\nby the Cult-owned BBC and most of the rest of the mainstream\\nmedia, but they delighted in reporting how police were injured in\\n‘clashes with protestors’. The truth was that a group of people\\ngathered in Hyde Park at the end of one march when most had gone\\nhome and they were peacefully having a good time with music and\\nchat. Face-Nappies who couldn’t deal with the full-march crowd\\nthen waded in with their batons and got more than they bargained\\nfor. Instead of just standing for this criminal brutality the crowd\\nused their numerical superiority to push the Face-Nappies out of the park. Eventually the Nappies turned and ran. Unfortunately two or\\nthree idiots in the crowd threw drink cans striking two oﬃcers\\nwhich gave the media and the government the image they wanted to\\ndiscredit the 99.9999 percent who were peaceful. The idiots walked\\nstraight into the trap and we must always be aware of potential\\nagent provocateurs used by the authorities to discredit their targets.\\nThis response from the crowd – the can people apart – must be a\\nturning point when the public no longer stand by while the innocent\\nare arrested and brutally a\\x00acked by the Face-Nappies. That doesn’t\\nmean to be violent, that’s the last thing we need. We’ll leave the\\nviolence to the Face-Nappies and government. But it does mean that\\nwhen the Face-Nappies use violence against peaceful people the\\nnumerical superiority is employed to stop them and make citizen’s\\narrests or Common Law arrests for a breach of the peace. The time\\nfor being passive in the face of fascism is over.\\nWe are the many, they are the few, and we need to make that count\\nbefore there is no freedom le\\x00 and our children and grandchildren\\nface an ongoing fascist nightmare.\\nCOME ON PEOPLE – IT’S TIME.\\n \\nOne final thought …\\nThe power of love\\nA force from above\\nCleaning my soul\\nFlame on burn desire\\nLove with tongues of ﬁre\\nPurge the soul\\nMake love your goal I’ll protect you from the hooded claw\\nKeep the vampires from your door\\nWhen the chips are down I’ll be around\\nWith my undying, death-defying\\nLove for you\\nEnvy will hurt itself\\nLet yourself be beautiful\\nSparkling love, ﬂowers\\nAnd pearls and pre\\x00y girls\\nLove is like an energy\\nRushin’ rushin’ inside of me\\nThis time we go sublime\\nLovers entwine, divine, divine,\\nLove is danger, love is pleasure\\nLove is pure – the only treasure\\nI’m so in love with you\\nPurge the soul\\nMake love your goal\\nThe power of love\\nA force from above\\nCleaning my soul\\nThe power of love\\nA force from above\\nA sky-scraping dove Flame on burn desire\\nLove with tongues of ﬁre\\nPurge the soul\\nMake love your goal\\nFrankie Goes To Hollywood T\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nA p p e n d i x \\nCowan-Kaufman-Morell Statement on Virus Isolation\\n(SOVI)\\nIsolation: The action of isolating; the fact or condition of being\\nisolated or standing alone; separation from other things or persons;\\nsolitariness\\nOxford English Dictionary\\nhe controversy over whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus has ever\\nbeen isolated or puriﬁed continues. However, using the above\\ndeﬁnition, common sense, the laws of logic and the dictates of\\nscience, any unbiased person must come to the conclusion that the\\nSARS-CoV-2 virus has never been isolated or puriﬁed. As a result, no\\nconﬁrmation of the virus’ existence can be found. The logical,\\ncommon sense, and scientiﬁc consequences of this fact are:\\n \\nthe structure and composition of something not shown to exist\\ncan’t be known, including the presence, structure, and function of\\nany hypothetical spike or other proteins;\\nthe genetic sequence of something that has never been found can’t\\nbe known;\\n“variants” of something that hasn’t been shown to exist can’t be\\nknown;\\nit’s impossible to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease\\ncalled Covid-19. 1\\n2\\n \\nIn as concise terms as possible, here’s the proper way to isolate,\\ncharacterize and demonstrate a new virus. First, one takes samples\\n(blood, sputum, secretions) from many people (e.g. 500) with\\nsymptoms which are unique and speciﬁc enough to characterize an\\nillness. Without mixing these samples with ANY tissue or products\\nthat also contain genetic material, the virologist macerates, ﬁlters\\nand ultracentrifuges i.e. purifies  the specimen. This common virology\\ntechnique, done for decades to isolate bacteriophages1 and so-called\\ngiant viruses in every virology lab, then allows the virologist to\\ndemonstrate with electron microscopy thousands of identically sized\\nand shaped particles. These particles are the isolated and puriﬁed\\nvirus.\\nThese identical particles are then checked for uniformity by\\nphysical and/or microscopic techniques. Once the purity is\\ndetermined, the particles may be further characterized. This would\\ninclude examining the structure, morphology, and chemical\\ncomposition of the particles. Next, their genetic makeup is\\ncharacterized by extracting the genetic material directly from the\\npuriﬁed particles and using genetic-sequencing techniques, such as\\nSanger sequencing, that have also been around for decades. Then\\none does an analysis to conﬁrm that these uniform particles are\\nexogenous (outside) in origin as a virus is conceptualized to be, and\\nnot the normal breakdown products of dead and dying tissues.2 (As\\nof May 2020, we know that virologists have no way to determine\\nwhether the particles they’re seeing are viruses or just normal break-\\ndown products of dead and dying tissues.)3\\n \\nIsolation, characterization and analysis of bacteriophages from the haloalkaline lake Elmenteita,\\nKenyaJuliah Khayeli Akhwale et al, PLOS One, Published: April 25, 2019.\\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215734 – accessed 2/15/21\\n“Extracellular Vesicles Derived From Apoptotic Cells: An Essential Link Between Death and\\nRegeneration,” Maojiao Li1 et al, Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2020 October 2.\\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.573511/full – accessed 2/15/21 3 “The Role of Extraellular Vesicles as Allies of HIV, HCV and SARS Viruses,” Flavia Giannessi, et al,\\nViruses, 2020 May\\n \\nIf we have come this far then we have fully isolated, characterized,\\nand genetically sequenced an exogenous virus particle. However, we\\nstill have to show it is causally related to a disease. This is carried\\nout by exposing a group of healthy subjects (animals are usually\\nused) to this isolated, puriﬁed virus in the manner in which the\\ndisease is thought to be transmi\\x00ed. If the animals get sick with the\\nsame disease, as conﬁrmed by clinical and autopsy ﬁndings, one has\\nnow shown that the virus actually causes a disease. This\\ndemonstrates infectivity and transmission of an infectious agent.\\nNone of these steps has even been a\\x00empted with the SARS-CoV-2\\nvirus, nor have all these steps been successfully performed for any\\nso-called pathogenic virus. Our research indicates that a single study\\nshowing these steps does not exist in the medical literature.\\nInstead, since 1954, virologists have taken unpuriﬁed samples\\nfrom a relatively few people, o\\x00en less than ten, with a similar\\ndisease. They then minimally process this sample and inoculate this\\nunpuriﬁed sample onto tissue culture containing usually four to six\\nother types of material – all of which contain identical genetic\\nmaterial as to what is called a “virus.” The tissue culture is starved\\nand poisoned and naturally disintegrates into many types of\\nparticles, some of which contain genetic material. Against all\\ncommon sense, logic, use of the English language and scientiﬁc\\nintegrity, this process is called “virus isolation.” This brew\\ncontaining fragments of genetic material from many sources is then\\nsubjected to genetic analysis, which then creates in a computer-\\nsimulation process the alleged sequence of the alleged virus, a so\\ncalled in silico genome. At no time is an actual virus conﬁrmed by\\nelectron microscopy. At no time is a genome extracted and\\nsequenced from an actual virus. This is scientiﬁc fraud. The observation that the unpuriﬁed specimen — inoculated onto\\ntissue culture along with toxic antibiotics, bovine fetal tissue,\\namniotic ﬂuid and other tissues — destroys the kidney tissue onto\\nwhich it is inoculated is given as evidence of the virus’ existence and\\npathogenicity. This is scientiﬁc fraud.\\nFrom now on, when anyone gives you a paper that suggests the\\nSARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated, please check the methods\\nsections. If the researchers used Vero cells or any other culture\\nmethod, you know that their process was not isolation. You will hear\\nthe following excuses for why actual isolation isn’t done:\\n1. There were not enough virus particles found in samples from patients to analyze.\\n2. Viruses are intracellular parasites; they can’t be found outside the cell in this manner.\\nIf No. 1 is correct, and we can’t ﬁnd the virus in the sputum of sick\\npeople, then on what evidence do we think the virus is dangerous or\\neven lethal? If No. 2 is correct, then how is the virus spread from\\nperson to person? We are told it emerges from the cell to infect\\nothers. Then why isn’t it possible to ﬁnd it?\\nFinally, questioning these virology techniques and conclusions is\\nnot some distraction or divisive issue. Shining the light on this truth\\nis essential to stop this terrible fraud that humanity is confronting.\\nFor, as we now know, if the virus has never been isolated, sequenced\\nor shown to cause illness, if the virus is imaginary, then why are we\\nwearing masks, social distancing and pu\\x00ing the whole world into\\nprison?\\nFinally, if pathogenic viruses don’t exist, then what is going into\\nthose injectable devices erroneously called “vaccines,” and what is\\ntheir purpose? This scientiﬁc question is the most urgent and\\nrelevant one of our time. We are correct.

The doctor did not\\neven know that the ‘vaccines’ were not fully approved or that their\\ntrials were ongoing. They were, however, asking their patients if\\nthey minded taking part in follow-ups for research purposes – yes,\\nthe ongoing clinical trial. The nurse said the doctor’s ignorance was\\nnot rare and she had spoken to a hospital consultant who had the jab\\nwithout any idea of the background or that the ‘trials’ had not been\\ncompleted. Nurses and pharmacists had shown the same ignorance. ‘My NHS colleagues have forsaken their duty of care, broken their\\ncode of conduct – Hippocratic Oath – and have been brainwashed\\njust the same as the majority of the UK public through propaganda\\n…’ She said she had not been able to recruit a single NHS colleague,\\ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist to stand with her and speak out.

I shifted in my seat.\\n“The point is, what can we do about this? We can ignore it and deny it\\nand pretend this therapy is all about you.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='THE THERAPY ROOM WAS A SMALL, narrow rectangle; as bare as a prison cell,\\nor barer. The window was closed and barred. A bright pink box of tissues\\non the small table struck a discordantly cheerful note—presumably it was\\nplaced there by Indira: I couldn’t imagine Christian offering tissues to his\\npatients.\\nI sat on one of two battered, faded armchairs. The minutes passed. No\\nsign of Alicia. Perhaps she wasn’t coming? Perhaps she had refused to meet\\nme. She would be perfectly within her rights.\\nImpatient, anxious, nervous, I abandoned sitting and jumped up and\\nwalked to the window. I peered out between the bars.\\nThe courtyard was three stories below me. The size of a tennis court, it\\nwas surrounded by tall redbrick walls, walls that were too high to climb,\\nthough doubtless some had tried. Patients were herded outside for thirty\\nminutes of fresh air every afternoon, whether they wanted it or not, and in\\nthis freezing weather I didn’t blame them for resisting. Some stood alone,\\nmuttering to themselves, or they paced back and forth, like restless\\nzombies, going nowhere. Others huddled in groups, talking, smoking,\\narguing. Voices and shouts and strange excitable laughter floated up to me.\\nI couldn’t see Alicia at first. Then I located her. She was standing alone at\\nthe far end of the courtyard, by the wall.

I requested he\\nphrase it as a request, not a demand. Alicia stood still as he spoke to her.\\nBut she neither nodded nor shook her head nor gave any indication of\\nhaving heard him.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='his death; she was the one who had money, inherited from her father.\\nAnd so it went on, endless speculation—no answers, only more questions\\n—about Alicia’s motives and her subsequent silence. Why did she refuse to\\nspeak? What did it mean? Was she hiding something? Protecting someone?\\nIf so, who? And why?\\nAt the time, I remember thinking that while everyone was talking,\\nwriting, arguing, about Alicia, at the heart of this frantic, noisy activity\\nthere was a void—a silence. A sphinx.\\nDuring the trial, the judge took a dim view of Alicia’s persistent refusal\\nto speak. Innocent people, Mr. Justice Alverstone pointed out, tended to\\nproclaim their innocence loudly—and often. Alicia not only remained silent, but she showed no visible signs of remorse. She didn’t cry once\\nthroughout the trial—a fact made much of in the press—her face remaining\\nunmoved, cold. Frozen.\\nThe defense had little choice but to enter a plea of diminished\\nresponsibility: Alicia had a long history of mental health problems, it was\\nclaimed, dating back to her childhood. The judge dismissed a lot of this as\\nhearsay—but in the end he allowed himself to be swayed by Lazarus\\nDiomedes, professor of forensic psychiatry at Imperial College, and clinical\\ndirector of the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London. Professor\\nDiomedes argued that Alicia’s refusal to speak was in itself evidence of\\nprofound psychological distress—and she should be sentenced accordingly.\\nThis was a rather roundabout way of saying something that psychiatrists\\ndon’t like putting bluntly:\\nDiomedes was saying Alicia was mad.\\nIt was the only explanation that made any sense: Why else tie up the man\\nyou loved to a chair and shoot him in the face at close range? And then\\nexpress no remorse, give no explanation, not even speak? She must be mad.\\nShe had to be.\\nIn the end, Mr. Justice Alverstone accepted the plea of diminished\\nresponsibility and advised the jury to follow suit. Alicia was subsequently\\nadmitted to the Grove—under the supervision of the same Professor\\nDiomedes whose testimony had been so influential with the judge.\\nIf Alicia wasn’t mad—that is, if her silence was merely an act, a\\nperformance for the benefit of the jury—then it had worked. She was spared\\na lengthy prison sentence—and if she made a full recovery, she might well\\nbe discharged in a few years. Surely now was the time to begin faking that\\nrecovery? To utter a few words here and there, then a few more; to slowly\\ncommunicate some kind of remorse? But no. Week followed week, month\\nfollowed month, then the years passed—and still Alicia didn’t speak.\\nThere was simply silence.\\nAnd so, with no further revelation forthcoming, the disappointed media\\neventually lost interest in Alicia Berenson. She joined the ranks of other\\nbriefly famous murderers; faces we remember, but whose names we forget.\\nNot all of us. Some people—myself included—continued to be\\nfascinated by the mystery of Alicia Berenson and her enduring silence. As a\\npsychotherapist, I thought it obvious that she had suffered a severe trauma\\nsurrounding Gabriel’s death; and this silence was a manifestation of that trauma. Unable to come to terms with what she had done, Alicia stuttered\\nand came to a halt, like a broken car. I wanted to help start her up again—\\nhelp Alicia tell her story, to heal and get well. I wanted to fix her.\\nWithout wishing to sound boastful, I felt uniquely qualified to help Alicia\\nBerenson. I’m a forensic psychotherapist and used to working with some of\\nthe most damaged, vulnerable members of society. And something about\\nAlicia’s story resonated with me personally—I felt a profound empathy\\nwith her right from the start.\\nUnfortunately, I was still working at Broadmoor in those days, and so\\ntreating Alicia would have—should have—remained an idle fantasy, had\\nnot fate unexpectedly intervened.\\nNearly six years after Alicia was admitted, the position of forensic\\npsychotherapist became available at the Grove. As soon as I saw the advert,\\nI knew I had no choice. I followed my gut—and applied for the job. CHAPTER THREE\\nMY NAME IS THEO FABER. I’m forty-two years old. And I became a\\npsychotherapist because I was fucked-up. That’s the truth—though it’s not\\nwhat I said during the job interview, when the question was put to me.\\n“What drew you to psychotherapy, do you think?” asked Indira Sharma,\\npeering at me over the rims of her owlish glasses.\\nIndira was consultant psychotherapist at the Grove. She was in her late\\nfifties with an attractive round face and long jet-black hair streaked with\\ngray. She gave me a small smile—as if to reassure me this was an easy\\nquestion, a warm-up volley, a precursor to trickier shots to follow.\\nI hesitated. I could feel the other members of the panel looking at me. I\\nremained conscious of maintaining eye contact as I trotted out a rehearsed\\nresponse, a sympathetic tale about working part-time in a care home as a\\nteenager; and how this inspired an interest in psychology, which led to a')]"

She has melted into the background and become almost invisible to the other patients.\\n2. **Violent behavior**: There is an incident where Alicia becomes violent and tries to slash Elif's throat with a jagged edge. This suggests that she may have a history of aggression or anger issues.\\n3. **Self-harming behavior**: Alicia has a history of self-harm, having slashed her wrists twice and engaged in other forms of self-harm upon admission to the unit.\\n4. **Difficulty interacting with others**: Alicia does not seem to have any interest in interacting with the other patients or the staff, which suggests that she may have difficulties with social relationships or may be experiencing emotional numbness.\\n5. **Lack of emotional expression**: When Yuri speaks to her, she does not respond or show any indication of having heard him, which suggests that she may be experiencing emotional flatness or apathy.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that these characteristics are based on a limited observation and may not be a comprehensive representation of Alicia's personality or behavior.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 257, 'prompt_tokens': 3894, 'total_tokens': 4151, 'completion_time': 0.54319374, 'prompt_time': 0.357391229, 'queue_time': 1.679161093, 'total_time': 0.900584969}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_510c177af0', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--72a9439e-6ae7-412b-bcab-f77f85e6495d-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3894, 'output_tokens': 257, 'total_tokens': 4151}\n"
